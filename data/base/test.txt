Tributes pour in for late British Labour Party leader
Tributes poured in from around the world Thursday to the late Labour Party leader John Smith , who died earlier from a massive heart attack aged 55 .
In Washington , the US State Department issued a statement regretting " the untimely death " of the rapier-tongued Scottish barrister and parliamentarian .
" Mr. Smith , throughout his distinguished career in government and in opposition , left a profound impression on the history of his party and his country , " State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said .
" Secretary ( of State Warren ) Christopher extends his deepest condolences to Mrs. Smith and to the Smith children . "
In Bonn , the head of the German Social Democratic Party , Rudolf Scharping , said in a statement he was " very affected by the sudden death of John Smith .
" A good friend of German social democracy has left us too early . He was very close to achieving his life 's goal of making the Labour Party the largest political force in Britain " and would be " cruelly missed " in Europe , he said .
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten , a former Conservative Party chairman , offered his condolences to the Smith family and said his former politcal opponent was a " good and decent man , widely respected . "
In France , French President Francois Mitterrand sent a message of condolences to Smith 's widow Elizabeth and to Labour Party general-secretary Larry Whitty .
Rocard had spent Wednesday evening with Smith and his wife after attending the launch in London of the Labour Party campaign for the European elections .
" He was in great shape last night , and this came as a shock to me , " Rocard said . " John Smith was a fervant European . He fought for a Great Britain that would have a leading role in the building of Europe . "
In Brussels , European Commission President Jacques Delors , a French socialist , said Smith was " a friend and companion in the struggle for justice and solidarity . "
He would be " sorely missed by all who are striving for progress and , in particular , by all true Europeans . "
The Party of European Socialists also expressed its sorrow . Party president , Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes , said : " Scotland and Britain have lost a great man , Europe has lost a great ally and the socialist family has lost a great leader .
" We have lost not just a great friend but a convinced and convincing European whose ideals and work sprang from deeply-held moral convictions and sense of justice . "
In Lisbon , Portuguese Socialist Party general secretary Antonio Guterres sent a message of condolences to Smith 's widow .
In London , the Socialist International , expressed its " profound sadness " in a letter signed by president Pierre Mauroy , a former French Socialist premier , and general secretary Luis Ayale . Smith was the group 's deputy president .
France rules out participation in military invasion of Haiti
France would not join a US military invasion of Haiti as part of an effort to restore democratic rule , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday .
Juppe , in Washington for talks with US officials , said he told US President Bill Clinton that Paris had ruled out participation in such an invasion force , which has been suggested as an option by Clinton and urged by some members of Congress .
" I confirmed that military intervention to kick out the military leadership is out of the question for us , " Juppe told reporters in Washington .
The French diplomat meanwhile reiterated his condemnation of the military regime in Port-au-Prince and the naming Wednesday of interim president Emile Jonassaint , whom Juppe described as a " puppet with no legitimacy . "
He said France was working to enforce the latest UN Security Council resolution calling for stiffer sanctions if the military refuses to leave power and restore democracy by May 21 .
France also was prepared to participate in a UN multinational force to help train a new Haitian police force once democracy is restored , Juppe noted .
Juppe said such a force was in the process of being sent to Haiti last October before the collapse of an agreement to restore exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
In an implicit criticism of US handling of the matter , Juppe said , " Unfortunately the boat ( with US and Canadian troops ) turned back because there were a few people making noise on the port . "
Chinese dissidents in US favor partial revoking of MFN
Chinese dissidents in the United States generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing 's privileged trading status targeting state-owned firms , not complete revocation , dissident leaders said here Thursday .
There are differing views among the dissident community in the United States on the best way to advance human rights in China , but " an overwhelming majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted revocation , " Zhao Haiching , the president of the National Council for Chinese Affairs ( NCCA ) told a press conference .
China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if he were to extend Beijing 's most favored nation ( MFN ) trading status beyond June 3 , Zhao said .
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the government 's intransigence , said Zhao , whose group coordinates dissident groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China .
Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its human rights record , while not punishing the private sector and market economy which everybody wants to promote , Zhao said .
Zhao also said it was the United States 's own fault that its decision to firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit .
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China " that all they have to do to win MFN is play tough , and they have been doing so , " Zhao said .
Economic officials in the government made it clear early that revoking human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States .
Chinese dissident Wang Juntao , jailed for his part in the 1989 pro-democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square massacre , is in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US officials .
Wang said that his release was a miracle , but urged the international community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in China .
Wang was to meet with Clinton 's national security advisor Anthony Lake Thursdsay and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord Friday .
Nagorno Karabakh hit by further clashes amid ceasefire reports
The Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno Karabakh was torn by further fighting Thursday as unconfirmed reports of a possible new ceasefire circulated .
Russian foreign ministry sources said a ceasefire accord was agreed Wednesday between the Azeri and Armenian defence ministers as well as pro-Armenian separatist forces fighting to prise the enclave from Azeri administration .
The area has a largely Armenian population but falls within Azerbajian .
The accord was due to have come into effect overnight but a spokesman for the Armenian rebels in the province told AFP there had been merely a photocopied exchange of propositions Wednesday on a possible laying down of arms .
Armenia 's defence minister meanwhile told AFP that Yerevan was in no way party to a decision .
Karabakh troops accused Azerbaijan of launching an attack Thursday on the back of intensive artillery bombardments around Agdam , just beyond the eastern edge of the disputed enclave and now under Armenian control .
ITAR-TASS quoted the Azeri minister of defence as saying Baku 's forces had for more than 24 hours been engaged in clashes with the aim of retaking two villages in northern Karabakh .
A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry called on the warring parties to " respect scrupulously " the reported ceasefire agreement but also questioned the willingness of their political masters to seek a peaceful solution .
Many earlier ceasefire accords have been broken in the conflict which has claimed more than 20,000 lives since fighting broke out in February 1988 .
Peace talks chaired by the inter-parliamentary assembly of the Commonwealth of Independent States failed last week in Kirghizstan .
This restart looks good by Jim Slater
This time , Nigel Mansell will not be left behind on a restart .
The English racer 's bid for victory here last year in his first Indianapolis 500 was foiled when eventual winner Emerson Fittpaldi and runner-up Arie Luyendyk passed him when a mid-race caution period ended .
That was how Mansell learned passing was allowed on the 2.5-mile ( 4k ) oval here as soon as the green flag waves , not at the start-finish line .
" The restart was a painful lesson regarding the rules of the race track , " Mansell said . " There are some different rules here . Now I know about them . I wasn 't as prepared as I will be this year . "
The reigning Indy-car series champion will be among top contenders in Saturday 's battle for pole position in the 78th Indy 500 . Time trials for the May 29 race continue the next two weekends .
" I 'm optimistic , yes , but confident , no , " Mansell said . " It 's going to be a tough weekend . This track stands alone as king of the circuits . It carries a lot more excitement for the driver . It 's incredibly demanding here . "
Mansell 's Cosworth-powered Lola has a top speed of 227.969 mph ( 364.750 k / hr ) during this week 's practice sessions . That ranks fifth for the week behind Brazilian 's Fittipaldi and Raul Boesel , Canada 's Paul Tracy and Mansell 's teammate , Mario Andretti .
" I 'm pleased with my speeds , " Mansell said . " We will work on the car and try to go a little quicker yet . When I came back here the first day I was probably a one . Now I 'm maybe a six on a learning scale . I 'll be up to nine or 10 by Saturday . But it takes time . "
Mansell went on to five Indy-car triumphs and the series title last season , but well remembers the one that got away .
" Last year I made some mistakes here and I 'm not going to make any excuses why they happened , " Mansell said . " The strategy will be very much the same . This time I 'm more comfortable and aware of a lot more situations . I will try to make sure I 'm in good shape and get the first 400 miles out of the way , then you really have to start charging and racing and go for it . "
Mansell 's Indy rookie of the year performance made most people forget he ws injured just a month earlier in a crash at Phoenix in his first oval effort .
" This year I can walk and it 's so much better , " Mansell said . " I have a comfort level mentally and physically . After the accident on the first oval , a lot of people said , ' I told you so . ' To have the dogged determination to come back and do well on the ovals showed a lot of people . "
Despite four oval triumphs last year , Mansell does not feel he has the circuits mastered .
" I 'm still learning about the ovals , " he said . " I haven 't adapted really . Oval racing is pure racing and I have always thought of myself as a racer . You get in traffic and you have dogfights and I forget I 'm on an oval . "
Mansell has not forgotten what the ovals have meant to him , however .
" Winning the Indy-car championship had more impact than winning the Formula One championship , " he said . " I was runner-up three times basically from 1986 , so when we eventually did win Formula One , everyone was so relieved . Winning here , everybody was more shocked and surprised . "
Aziz lobbies against oil embargo
Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Terek Aziz lobbied UN members in New York Thursday to lift the oil embargo against his country .
Next week the Security Council is to review the sanctions imposed against Baghdad following the invasion of Kuwait , and western diplomats are predicting that the four-year-old embargo will remain in force .
Aziz said the council should acknowledge that Iraq has complied with UN resolutions and that conditions for lifting the sanctions have been met .
Some members of the council refuse to recognize the progress Baghdad has made toward meeting the UN demands , Aziz said following a meeting with Nigeria 's Ibrahim Gambari , who holds the council 's rotating presidency .
Iraq is particularly keen on getting rid of the oil embargo in return for its agreement to meet UN disarmament requirements and has argued that the allied nations had not kept up their end of the bargain .
Aziz said the United States and Britain should " decide if they are in compliance with the resolutions they themselves voted or are using those resolutions to reach special , unilateral , political objectives . "
The vice-prime minister is to meet with several Security Council members before Tuesday 's session to review the embargo as well as with the head of the UN commission to oversee Iraq 's disarmament , Rolf Ekeus .
The commission is currently working on a system for monitoring Iraq 's weapons capabilities long-term which diplomats said could be operational by July .
A six-month probationary period would be required before the commission could verify Baghdad 's compliance with all the conditions to the Security Council , which would then consider lifting the sanctions , sources said .
RAF planes airlift evacuees out of Sanaa by Laurence Peter
Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreign evacuees , most of them British , to Cyprus Thursday from Sanaa as they fled the fighting in war-torn Yemen .
The evacuees who arrived at Lanarca airport later boarded a British Airways airliner bound for Gatwick airport , in southern Britain .
The BA plane was due to touch down at 1 : 20 a.m. ( 0020 GMT ) Friday . The planes had flown in from Dijoubti to Sanaa earlier Thursday to pick up the evacuees .
British construction worker Michael Wild said he had heard the blast from a Scud missile fired by southern forces into the centre of Sanaa on Wednesday from his hotel 1,000 metres away . It had shattered his hotel room windows .
He quoted local Yemenis as saying that 43 people had been killed and 10 injured in the attack .
The official agency SABA said Wednesday 25 civilians had been killed in the attack on the Yemeni capital .
A Hungarian neuro surgeon , who asked to be not identified , said " medical supplies are extremely low " at the main Al-Thawra hospital in Sanaa where he had been working .
He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were barely functioning and virtually all the hospital foreign staff mostly Bulgarians and Indians had left .
About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few days ago , he said
He added about 15 Somali refugees caught in the fighting between rival north and south forces were admitted with serious bullet wounds . " At least two of them died later , " he said .
Pilot Flight Lieutenant Nick Young said communications at Sanaa airport were " excellent " and praised the help offered by the Yemeni authorities .
He said he saw no damage to the airport , despite reported bombing raids by southern jets when the conflict erupted last week .
There were 75 evacuees on one plane and 73 on the other . About 20 were Americans , but there were also Dutch , New Zealanders , Swiss and Hungarians on board .
The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20 kilos of luggage per person .
Oil workers who were working with Yemen-Hunt Oil in the Marib field in northern Yemen said about 200 oil workers had stayed behind to keep operations running .
Some said Sanaa appeared to be a " ghost town " with many shops closed , and long queues at petrol stations .
Wild also added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party building in the capital had been devastated in an attack and the Italian embassy had been hit .
More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since fighting erupted between northern troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh and southern forces backing his rival Ali Salem al-Baid .
South African shoots ahead in Spain
Ernie Els was back to his best when the Spanish Open began at windy Club de Camp here Thursday .
The South African , who makes a habit of false starts , had seven birdies in his five-under-par 67 to take the lead from Zimbabwe 's Mark McNulty and England 's Steven Richardson and Peter Mitchell .
Els rocketed to his first European Tour victory back in January when he beat world number one Greg Norman by six strokes in the Desert Classic in Dubai .
But he missed the halfway cut at St Mellion in England last week when he returned following a two-week break .
" I was a bit rusty but I didn 't want to miss the elections back home , " said the 24-year-old from Johannesburg .
McNulty had five birdies on greens that became very fast in the wind and sun . " They were just my pace . I liked them very much , " he said .
He was playing only his third event on the European Tour this season after injuring his shoulder playing beach cricket with his children .
Seve Ballesteros was well satisfied with his first round 72 despite being five shots behind Els .
Last week Ballesteros had 16 pars and two birdies in his final round at the Benson and Hedges Open at St Mellion for his first tournament success for more than two years .
Today he parred the first 11 holes and his only two bogeys came when he missed a three-foot putt at the 13th and a six-footer at the 14th .
" I have been very steady and I should have had a much better score because I missed five birdie chances in the first nine holes , " he said .
Richardson , who has missed the cut in six of his last seven tournaments , hit his best form of the year when he covered his first nine holes in a six-under-par 30 . But he couldn 't keep it up , coming home in 38 .
US Senate vote on Bonsia " internal " matter says Juppe
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that a US Senate vote calling for a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia was a matter of internal politics in the United States .
" I got the impression that this is a message for internal use because the two amendments adopted are contradictory , " Juppe said after senators approved two separate measures calling for a multilateral lifting of the embargo and unilateral action by Washington .
" I was able to pick up from my discussions that the House of Representatives had no intention of approving a compulsory measure , " he added .
Juppe said that his discussions with President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher reinforced the idea that Washington was not moving toward a unilateral lifting of the embargo to help the Moslem-led Bosnian government defend itself .
( repetition ) RAF planes airlift evacuees out of Sanaa by Laurence Peter
Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreign evacuees , most of them British , to Cyprus Thursday from Sanaa as they fled the fighting in war-torn Yemen .
The evacuees who arrived at Larnaca airport later boarded a British Airways airliner bound for Gatwick airport , in southern Britain .
The BA plane was due to touch down at 1 : 20 a.m. ( 0020 GMT ) Friday . The planes had flown in from Djibouti to Sanaa earlier Thursday to pick up the evacuees .

Fresh advice from American tennis guru Nick Bolletieri propelled Boris Becker into his best clay court showing for two years .
The German slowed down enough to beat Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-3 , 6-4 . Becker last got this far on clay in Hamburg two years ago when he was beaten by compatriot Michael Stich in the semi-finals .
Bolletieri , who nurtured Andre Agassi , Jim Courier and Monica Seles in their formative years , has been with the German for three months .
" Nick makes work fun , " Becker said . " We have been working on clay for four weeks and every day I feel that I am playing a little bit better . "
Rightwing extremists chase Turkish group , injure five
Forty young far-rightwingers armed with knives and sticks chased a group of Turks through the eastern German town of Magdeburg Thursday , injuring five of them , police said .
The group came across the Turkish people at the end of the afternoon and chased them through the centre of the town .
Police , who said they made 15 arrests , did not detail the condition of any of the five injured .
Spurs payments charge shock
Tottenham Hotspur , the London giants who narrowly escaped relegation from the English Premiership , could yet go down after being accused of making " irregular " loans to players .
England star Paul Gascoigne , now with Italian club Lazio , was alleged to be one of the recipients of the loans , said to have ranged from 25,000 pounds to 70,000 pounds .
In 1990 Swindon Town , newly promoted to the old-style Division One , were relegated to Division Three after being found guilty of similar charges . On appeal they were finally placed in Division Two .
Although the Football Association could relegate Spurs , a heavy fine is more likely as the alleged offences occurred when Tottenham were under the jurisdiction of the Football League .
A three-man Premier League inquiry team spent more than six months investigating the allegations and the inquiry is continuing .
The loans were allegedly made to players between 1985 and 1989 . They were said to be worth more than 400,000 pounds but were never repaid .
The alleged offences occurred before Alan Sugar took control with the now England manager Terry Venables in 1991 .
Further investigations could relate to money allegedly offered by Tottenham to entice schoolboys to sign for the club .
North London rivals Arsenal were among several clubs who recently complained of an 87,000 pounds offer by Spurs to 13-year-old schoolboy Scott Parker .
FA chief executive Graham Kelly said Tottenham had 14 days in which to answer the charges .
Sugar claimed he had played a major role in bringing the business of the possible irregular payments to the attention of the game 's authorities .
" As soon as I gained full executive control of Tottenham , following the dismissal of Mr Venables in the summer of 1993 , I called a meeting with the FA and the Premier League for the purpose of alerting them to possible past irregularities . "
Venables had his private business , Edennote , wound up in the London High Court on Thursday after it ran up a debt of 183,750 pounds to his former club .
The move was a further twist in the long-running dispute between Venables and Sugar .
Venables has a one million pound legal action pending against the club for wrongful dismissal , as well as a claim for 100,000 pounds back tax against the Inland Revenue .
Radioactive capsule stolen in Ukraine

ITT to open 750 million dollar casino in Las Vegas
The US communications giant ITT announced plans Thursday for a 750 million dollar hotel and casino in Las Vegas .
" Desert Kingdom , " which is to be completed by early 1997 , will cover more than 13 hectares ( 32 acres ) with its huge casino and 2,500-room hotel .
Construction on the complex will begin this year using the latest water-conservation technology and labor costs alone are estimated to reach some 500,000 dollars a day . Once completed , the casino will employ about 5,000 workers .
The project , which will be financed through bond issues , follows the massive 2,500 room " Luxor " hotel-casino which opened last year in Las Vegas to the tune of 300 million dollars .
ITT owns the Sheraton hotel chain , which company president Kapioltas said received 140,000 requests for lodging in Las Vegas this year that it could not meet .
ITT Sheraton has 400 hotels in 61 countries . Its revenues last year reached 3.2 billion dollars . ITT posted 23 billion dollars in revenues for 1993 and profits were up 28 percent to 219 million dollars for the first quarter of this year .

Zhirinovsky quizzes Russian PM on place for party in government
Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Thursday he had approached Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin with a view to his party being given places in the government , Interfax said .
The meeting came days after the entry into Chernomyrdin 's team of Democratic Party president Nikolai Travkin , a centrist generally opposed to President Boris Yeltsin . Travkin did not receive a specific portfolio .
Zhirinovsky said he had spelled out three ways his party could receive governmental positions , preferably those of defence and interior , along with the counter-espionage portfolio . His Liberal Democratic Party also has its sights on the posts of justice minister , as well as the treasury and the ministry for privatisation .
" The head of the government now has to reflect , " Zhirinovsky said . " And we too are going to reflect on the position we are going to adopt in future vis-a-vis the government . "
Chernomyrdin 's office did not comment on the nationalist leader 's statements .
Zhirinovsky has had the foreign ministry , the defence ministry and the interior porfolio in his sights for the LDP since December 's parliamentary elections gave the party nearly 70 seats in the lower house of parliament .
He recently also demanded the resignation of six ministers .
World Cup organizers still fighting fences
World Cup fans at Stanford Stadium in California and in Washington are almost certain to be fenced in , against the wishes of FIFA and tournament organizers , World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg confirmed Thursday .
" The position of the organizing committee and FIFA is clear and consistent -- we are against fencing , " Rothenberg said . " Ultimately it 's the local law enforcement that has responsibility for the safety and security of the public . We don 't have any ability to veto their decisions . "
He said police in Dallas were also in favor of fences , but were still discussing the issue .
" We only have the power of persuasion , " Rothenberg said . " There is still a chance there might be modification in Dallas . We 're not aware of any possible changes at Stanford Stadium ( in Palo Alto , California ) or at RFK Stadium in Washington . "
Though many European clubs have fences , Rothenberg said the trend in Europe was away from fencing .
Fences were banned in England in 1989 after 95 Liverpool fans were crushed to death at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield during an FA Cup semi-final .
He also said organizers believed the bulk of fans at World Cup matches did not pose a threat to the safety of playes and officials on the pitches .
" Two-thirds of our tickets have been sold in the United States , " he said . " All our demographics indicate that is a family audience , a mother and father and two kids . That 's a group as unlikely to anything damaging as any group you can think of . "
Rothenberg said the football associations in countries where hooliganism is rife had efficient methods of preventing known troublemakers from buying Cup tickets .
" It is very unlikely that patrons of tour operators are troublemakers , " he said . " And the tickets distributed through the national associations , they have a pretty good distribution mechanism where they screen who buys . They tend to know who hooligans are and don 't sell to them . "
India puts prize on Bombay bomb blast suspects
India Thursday offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of an alleged underworld leader and 43 other suspects in Bombay bomb blasts last year .
The Central Bureau of Investigation put a prize of 50,000 dollars on Dawood Ibrahim , who allegedly controls a criminal empire in the western Indian city from an unknown safe haven abroad .
The same prize was offered for the arrest of Abdul Razak " Tiger " Memon , his suspected associate in the chain of bomb blasts which killed more than 300 people in Bombay in March last year .
Rewards declared for the arrest of the other suspects range between 25,000 rupees ( 833 dollars ) and one million rupees ( 33,333 dollars ) .
Ibrahim and the 43 others , mainly Moslem members of the Bombay underworld , have been declared fugitives , the bureau said .
According to the agency , Ibrahim sent arms and explosives by sea to the Indian west coast where one of his accomplices secured a safe landing with the help of unnamed custom officials .
The transportation of the arms and explosives , their storage in safe houses in and around Bombay and the blasts were handled by Memon and his brothers , it said .
The blasts rocked prominent commercial landmarks including the Bombay Stock Exchange and Air India headquarters , killing 317 people and injuring nearly 1,000 , in the world 's worst urban terrorist attack .
Investigators allege the March 1993 explosions were masterminded by Ibrahim in vengeance for attacks on Moslems by Hindu militants during communal riots that raged in Bombay in the preceding December and January .
The riots erupted following the destruction of the Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya by Hindu zealots on December 6 , 1992 .
Taiwan to allow massacre to feature in text books
A 1947 massacre of native Taiwanese people is to be mentioned for the first time in history textbooks , officials said Thursday .
A compilation board , made up of scholars and experts , has completed a draft of the new school textbook including details of the massacre by Nationalist troops which used to be a taboo subject here , education officials said .
The massacre , known as the February 28 Incident , which saw thousands of native Taiwanese people killed , has harmed relations between Taiwan natives and immigrants from China for many years .
The Nationalist government still ruled mainland China at the time it sent troops to suppress riots in Taiwan , which had reverted to Chinese rule after Japan was defeated at the end of World War II in 1945 .
The riots were started by native Taiwanese who claimed they were being ruled high-handedly by the Nationalist-controlled local government in Taiwan .
Now first year junior high school students here will be able to learn of the massacre in the book , tentatively entitled " Knowing Taiwan , " from the start of the 1995 academic year , the officials said .
The book will also present details of the economic , social and political conditions during the martial law period from 1949 to 1987 .
The Nationalists fled to Taiwan from the mainland after being defeated by the communists in the 1949 civil war .
China announces new ministers
China replaced three ministers on Thursday , the official Xinhua press agency reported .
The ministries of Radio , Film and Television , Geology and Mineral Resources and the Auditing Administration all got new chiefs , the report monitored in Hong Kong said .
Sun Jiazheng , 50 , takes over as radio , film and television minister , from Ai Zhisheng ; Song Ruixiang , 54 , is new head of the geology and mineral resources ministry , succeeding Zhu Xun , and Guo Zhenqian , 61 , becomes Auditor-general , replacing Lu Peijan .
The new radio minister was head of the propaganda department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and is a communist party cadre .
Song was vice minister of the geology and mineral resources minister . His predecessor Zhu becomes secretary-general of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference .
Guo , a former vice-governor of the Peoples ' Bank of China , is decibed by Xinhua as being " familiar with the macro-economy and a capable leader . "
The appointments were confirmed by China 's parliament at the seventh session of the standing committe of the National People 's Congress , which ended Thursday , the report said .
Jiang meets Malaysia PM , defends Tiananmen
Chinese President Jiang Zemin Thursday defended the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square , saying China 's stability and prosperity had depended on it , Xinhua reported .
Jiang made the comments in a meeting with visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , the official news agency said in a report monitored here .
" A bad thing has been turned into a good thing and as a result our reform and opening program has forged ahead with steadier , better and even quicker steps and our advantages have been brought into fuller play , " Xinhua quoted him as saying .
" History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good , " Jiang said .
" The stability of China is not only needed for China 's own development , but will also benefit the stability of Asia and the world in general , " he added .
Mahathir said he had been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in China and that his government was satisfied with the steady growth of economic and trade ties with China , the report said .
Referring to his meeting in Washington with US President Bill Clinton shortly before his arrival in China , Mahathir said he had stressed that one country should not try to impose its views on another , Xinhua said .
He added that he had expressed his opposition to Washington 's using renewal of China 's Most Favoured Nation ( MFN ) status as a way to pressure Beijing .

Argentina call of Japan tour
Argentina have called off their two football internationals in Japan after Japanese authorities refused team captain Diego Maradona entry because of his drugs record .
Osamo Ighami , first counsel at the Japanese embassy , said Argentine Football Association president Julio Grondona had told him of the decision .
Ighami said the justice ministry ruling which barred Maradona was irreversible .
The Japanese justice ministry refused Maradona a visa because it said he had been implicated in drug cases more than once .
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for cocaine possession , and five months later was given a 14-month suspended sentence by an Italian court for using cocaine .
He was also suspended from international competition for 15 months in 1991 and 1992 after testing postive for cocaine use .
The justice ministry 's immigration bureau , however , granted a visa to Claudio Caniggia , who recently ended a 13-month soccer ban for his alleged use of cocaine . Caniggia would have been allowed to go to Japan because he had not faced criminal charges .
Argentine had planned to play Japan and France in Japan as part of their World Cup buildup .
Media bidding battle finances anorexic twin 's battle to live by Howard Williams
A 26-year-old anorexic 's fight for survival hung in the balance Thursday as the British woman awaited the outcome of a media bidding battle for her exclusive story .
The woman , whose twin sister has already dieted herself to death , was relying on the outcome of a battle between such British media giants as Granada Television and the Daily Mirror newspaper to pay her medical bills at an exclusive clinic which specializes in bringing victims of anorexia and bulimia back to the world of the living .
Samantha Kendall , 26 , is due to check in some time next week at the Montreux Society for Eating Disorders clinic , in a converted mansion in this posh Pacific coast city .
But first she is scheduled to appear in New York on the Maury Povitch Show , a television chat show on the Fox Television Network which has agreed to pay some of Kendall 's expenses .
Then , if everything goes well , Kendall will be flown to British Columbia to check in for between six months and a year , said the clinic 's spokeswoman Laurie Winn Stanley .
Winn Stanley said the cost of the treatment could run anywhere from 75,000 Canadian dollars ( 54,000 US ) to 200,000 dollars ( 144,000 US ) , depending on the patient 's length of stay .
" In our experience , " Winn Stanley told AFP , " she will need to be here for at least six months and , depending on her progress , she might have to stay for a year .
" So we have to be fairly sure that our costs will be covered . We are a non-profit organisation and we are not able to carry the costs ourselves . "
Hence the importannce of the media bidding battle in Britain .
" We 've advised the family how to go about it . But the mother ( Susie , 47 ) hasn 't listened to us . I believe she gave a television interview in Britain for just 2,000 pounds ( less than 3,000 USD ) .
" They really must get the money together . "
Winn Stanley said she was waiting for news from Britain about the bidding battle . She said she understood the bidders included Granada Television , Central Tevision and the Daily Mirror -- " it seems Granada and the Daily Mirror are the front-runners , but there 's no shortage of bidders . "
If Samantha 's bid for the money is successful , her bid for life will start next week in what Winn Stanley described as " a large mansion with three suites with up to two patients in each suite . "
Winn Stanley said that , initially , Samantha would need around-the-clock care during which she would be hand-fed by two professional carers .
" There is no force-feeding , there are no tubes , " insisted Winn Stanley .
Stage two , once the patient has returned to a pattern of fairly normal eating , is therapy , said Winn Stanley .
" It 's intensive , " she said . " It 's a very supporting environment . "
Samantha 's problems began 13 years ago when she and her twin sister , Michaela , made a " slimming pact " when they were sick of being teased at school for being overweight .
But nearly four weeks ago , Michaela died -- suffering from anorexia nervosa , the so-called dieter 's disease . Michaela weighed just 25 kilos ( 56 pounds ) when she died .
A shocked Samantha appeared on British television this week admitting : " I don 't know how much time I have left because the dieting has done so much to my body . "
Appearing emaciated and cadaver-like , Samantha told another reporter in a separate interview : " My bones are sticking out so much now that it 's too painful to even lie in the bath . "
The girls ' mother said the twins each weighed 82 kilos ( 182 pounds ) when as 14-year-olds they made their pact which would prove so deadly .
Despite massive drops in weight , psychiatric counselling and hospital treatment , the girls continued their death diet into adulthood .
Boutros-Ghali urges that safe areas be clearly defined
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended Thursday that the United Nations clearly define the boundaries around the six designated safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina .
In a report to the Security Council released Thursday , the secretary general also said that UN Protection Forces have been stretched to the limit and should not be asked to establish more safe havens in Bosnia-Hercegovina .
The United Nations should define precise boundaries for the six existing safe areas of Sarajevo , Srebrenica , Tuzla , Zepa , Gorazde and Bihac , Boutros-Ghali said .
Brcko had been proposed as another site for a safe area .
The United Nations established the six safe zones about 18 months ago to protect Bosnian Moslem populations concentrated in those areas from relentless Bosnian Serbian attack .
The difficulty in using already overburdened peacekeeping forces to establish the zones and protect the population makes safe havens a temporary solution and precludes the United Nations from creating more of them , he said .
" UNPROFOR , overstretched and underresourced as it is in relation to its current mandates , does not have the capacity to rush from crisis to crisis in different areas .
" It is neither configured nor equipped for mandates to fight or to hold ground , " he said , adding that it is designed for quick deployment rather than fixed position .
" These factors dictate clear limits to the concept of safe areas , " he stressed .
He also pointed to a recent council resolution demanding a halt to all provocative action in security zones , a demand apparently aimed at Bosnian Moslems who have recently been accused of violating rules governing the safe areas .
" It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina , which requires a political and territorial solution , " he said .
Feyenoord take Dutch Cup
Feyenoord beat second division Nijmegen 2-1 in the Dutch Cup final on their own pitch here on Thursday .
It was Feyenoord 's third win in four years and ninth all-told .
Ruud Heus opened the score with a seventh minute penalty and Feyenoord went further ahead through John van Loen in the 80th minute .
Bennie Dekker scored a consolation goal for Nijmegen in the last minute .
Dutch Cup Final
It 's a big weekend in India-No-Place by Jim Slater
Once dubbed India-No-Place because nothing exciting ever happened here , this central US city is preparing for its greatest weekend ever .
Along with the traditional excitement of pole qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 , the city plays host to a visit by US president Bill Clinton and two sold-out National Basketball Association playoff games .
Add a Star Trek convention and sports memorabilia show to the mix and you have the busiest event schedule here since the 1987 Pan American Games .
" It 's quite a weekend , " Indiana Pacers vice president Dale Raterman said . " Sports fans here are excited . They 've really caught the fever . "
Indy 500 time trials begin Saturday , with more than 250,000 people expected at Indianapolis Motor Speedway . Qualifying continues Sunday as racers attempt to fill the 33-car field for the May 29 race .
But adding to the excitement are the Indiana Pacers , who have advanced to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time ever . They play Atlanta here Saturday and Sunday afternoons in downtown Market Square Arena , while the qualifying continues on the west side of town .
" We want a little May madness of our own , " Indiana guard Reggie Miller said . " We know this is a big time at the speedway , but I would like to see some of the drivers at our game . "
Miller might have to wait until Sunday , after most of the top racers have made the field . But he vows to support any drivers who support the Pacers .
" I want to see Emmo Fittipaldi , Raul Boesel , Mario and Michael Andretti and the rest cheering for us , " Miller said . " I 've never been to the speedway , but if they come , I will go there . That 's a fair trade off . "
The NBA-Indy 500 conflict has caused the greatest problem for Indianapolis media sports coordinator Bill York , who handles press duties for the speedway as well as the city 's NBA and National Football League clubs . He cannot be in two places at once , so the 60 -year-old manager will handle first-day speedway duties and rejoin the Pacers on Sunday .
" It 's too involved out here on Saturday with everybody qualifying , " York said . " It 's a shame to have to miss one or the other . "
Reports said Clinton feels the same way . Rumors have him scheduled to attend at least part of the Pacers ' game and 500 time trials . He is here for a political meeting and to dedicate a memorial to Bobby Kennedy .
Clinton attended the US college basketball finals because his home-state Arkansas Razorbacks were involved .
Senate deals blow to Clinton with Bosnia vote by Christian Chaise
The Senate defied President Bill Clinton on Thursday by approving a measure that would require the United States to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia unilaterally .
Although the amendment , approved 50 to 49 , has little chance of becoming law , it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on resolving the conflict .
The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war .
Although Clinton has pressed for a multilateral lifting of the embargo , he has maintained that a unilateral effort by Washington could undermine other UN actions around the world .
The measure goes to the House of Representatives , where it was expected to have little chance of passage . But even if it were approved , Clinton could veto the measure , and a two-thirds majority of both houses would be needed to override the veto .
Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell said the measure had no chance of becoming law .
Earlier , senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies to lift the embargo . By placing the two amendments in the same bill , senators appeared to give contradictory directives to the president .
" Lifting the arms embargo is the only feasible option that will permit the Bosnian government to defend itself , " said Senator Joseph Biden following the vote on the bill .
The administration had no immediate comment on the vote but State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said earlier that passing the measure would be " problematic . "
He also suggested it would send a conflicting message to Geneva , when the foreign ministers from Europe , Russia and the United States will be meeting to discuss the Balkan conflict Friday .
Europe and Russia have argued that an end to the arms embargo would escalate the fighting and quash any chance to resolve the conflict diplomatically .
In New York , a diplomat said that the Security Council was unlikely to approve a resolution lifting the embargo , noting that even if it had a majority among the 15 members Russia would be sure to veto it .
Last year , a resolution introduced by Moslem and non-aligned countries to exempt Bosnian Moslems from the sanctions won only six of the nine votes necessary to pass . Five non-aligned members and the United States supported the resolution .
Earlier Sadako Ogata , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , said that lifting the arms embargo would not help efforts to bring peace to Bosnia-Hercegovina after more than two years of brutal war .
" From a humanitarian point of view ... the number one objective I would like to see achieved is a ceasefire . Number two is a political settlement , " she said . " I hope all the meetings and decisions would lead to these two objectives . "
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic had appealed to members to pass the bill , and thanked Dole and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman for introducing it .
" The hopes of the Bosnian people are turned to the United States Senate , " he said recently .
The Argentine FA was believed to be negotiating with Chile and Denmark to replace the matches in Japan .
They would play Chile in Buenos Aires and travel to Copenhagen before going on to play scheduled matches in Tel Aviv and Zagreb .
Bus bonanza for Atlanta Games
The US government plans to help send 2,000 buses from around the nation to Atlanta for use at the 1996 Olympics .
The Federal Transit Administration plans to use 16 million dollars in discretionary funds to help pay to deliver and prepare the buses , which will be fitted with communications equipment to promote scheduling flexibility .
The buses will be identified by their cities of origin . Transit authorities in New York , Houston , Birmingham , New Orleans , St. Louis , Orlando , Philadelphia and the state of New Jersey have pleged buses so far .
Games organizers predict 1.5 million visitors will flood Atlanta each day of the Olympics . Parts of the city will be closed to private cars and spectators will use Atlanta city buses and trains and the borrowed buses to reach events .
Former Italian health minister arrested
A former Italian health minister nicknamed Torquemada for his inquisitorial raids on hospitals to unmask fraud was arrested on corruption charges Thursday , judicial sources said in Naples .
The arrest of Francesco De Lorenzo of the Liberal Party comes after an investigation into bribes paid by pharmaceutical laboratories to a ministry official , to win government backing for higher prices .
The former minister , charged on 67 counts , is accused of receiving seven billion lira ( 4.5 million dollars ) in bribes between 1990 and 1992 .
The charges also cover his relations with advertising companies which carried out AIDS public awareness campaigns .
De Lorenzo , 56 , is an eminent doctor and popular television personality whose family is descended from the Neopolitan aristocracy .
He made his mark by campaigning against hospital fraud , earning the nickname Torquemada after descending on wards to unmask corruption .
But he was forced to resign in February 1993 after his 89-year-old father was arrested for receiving commission on the sale of a building .
Gunmen kill man in Belfast , loyalists claim responsibility
Gunmen burst into a house in north Belfast Thursday and killed a man at close range , police said .
The outlawed loyalist organisation the Ulster Freedom Fighters said they carried out the attack in a call to a local radio station .
According to a spokesman for Sinn Fein , the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army fighting British rule in Northern Ireland , the victim was a Catholic aged around 20 but not a Sinn Fein member .
The killing brought to 24 the number of people killed in sectarian violence in Northern Ireland since the start of the year .
Blue chips rally as interest rate tensions ease
Blue-chip stocks rallied Thursday amid easing long-term interest rates after the government released figures showing inflation under control .
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.80 points to close at 3,652.84 .
On the broader market , advancers outpaced decliners 1,184 to 977 with 659 shares unchanged . Some 274 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange .
On the bond market , interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.57 percent from 7.59 percent Wednesday , a sign of easing investor fears of inflation and higher rates .
The rates declined further earlier in the day but rebounded after San Francisco Federal Reserve president Robert Parry suggested he might favor boosting short-term rates again .
The decline in interest rates came after the release of a government report showing wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in April , surprising analysts .
The reports " relieve some of the fear that the economy was going to explode on the upside , " said Alfred Goldman of A.G. Edwards and Sons .
But he added that investors still have not ruled out another interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve , which has already raised rates three times this year .
Allied-Signal rose 1-1 / 2 to 35-3 / 4 , Sears 1-1 / 4 to 48-3 / 4 and Philip Morris 3 to 50-1 / 2 .
ITT fell 1-1 / 4 to 82-3 / 4 after announcing plans for a new Las Vegas casino , Texas Instruments was off 1-1 / 4 to 71-1 / 2 and J.P Morgan 3 / 4 to 61-5 / 8 .
( new series ) PLO announces members of its self-rule " cabinet "
The PLO on Thursday gave Israel a partial list of members of the Palestinian authority due to take power next week in Gaza and Jericho , the chief Palestinian negotiator said .
Nabil Shaath told a press conference " the ( Palestinian ) cabinet has been formed , I just transmitted it to Yitzhak Rabin , " the Israeli prime minister .
He said the PLO had agreed with Rabin that the new authority " will be functional from Wednesday . "
But he added the list given was still incomplete as it had only 15 of the 24 ( eds : correct ) members . The other nine would be appointed in three of four days at the latest .
He said the members included PLO chairman Yasser Arafat , Faisal Husseini , the leading PLO official in the occupied territories , Hanan Ashrawi , former spokeswoman of the negotiating team , Saeb Erekat , head of the Palestinian team to the bilateral talks and Shaath himself .
He said Arafat was due to enter the autonomous territories in June but " Arafat may have some surprises for us , and it could happen before that date . "
Shaath justified sending the partial list to Rabin saying " the Israelis want to be sure that we are serious . "
But Samir Goshe , leader of the Popular Struggle Front , denied in Tunis that he had officially agreed to take part in the authority , saying he had made his involvement conditional on a " democratisation " of the PLO 's working methods .
He said he had been surprised to see his name on the list announced by Shaath .
A Palestinian official at the PLO headquarters in Tunis said Arafat will continue his consultations over the remaining positions .
According to Shaath , the PLO 's offices for foreign affairs , refugees and its relations with Israel and Jewish organisations would stay in its Tunis headquarters .
Under last week 's PLO-Israel accord on implementing limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza strip and the West Bank town of Jericho , the authority is due to take over on May 25 .
Meanwhile in Jerusalem a police spokesman said Rabin had agreed to a draft plan to set up a special police section to deal specifically with issues relating to Palestinian autonomy .
Under the project devised by Police Minister Moshe Shahal 2,000 men will be temporarily based in the Maalei Adumin settlement in the occupied West Bank .
The spokesman said its role would be to supervise the organisation of Israeli-Palestinian patrols in Gaza and Jericho .
The partial list announcement came as 20 Palestinian policemen arrived in the Jericho region , and another group of 300 policemen was due to be deployed in Gaza later on Thursday following the initial 300 .
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza and Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday .
In all , 9,000 Palestinian policemen are due to be deployed in Gaza and Jericho .
Former Belmont champ Easy Goer dies
Easy Goer , whose rivalry with Sunday Silence defined the 1989 US racing season , died of natural causes Thursday at Claiborne Farm .
The eight-year-old stallian was a son of Alydar . He won 14 of 20 starts , with five seconds and one third , and was retired in 1990 after earning more than 4,873,770 dollars .
Easy Goer was the champion 2-year-old of 1998 . He won his first three starts in 1989 and started as favorite at the Kentucky Derby , which he lost to Sunday Silence .
He finished runner-up to Sunday Silence in the Preakness , but ruined Sunday Silence 's bid for the Triple Crown with an eight-length victory in the Belmont .
( new series ) French hostages probably free next week : Serb agency
Eleven French aid workers held hostage by Bosnian Serbs forces for the last month will probably be freed next week , the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said Thursday .
Charges against the 11 , accused of smuggling weapons to the mainly Moslem Bosnian army , " will be revised in their favour " and handed to the civil courts , said the agency , quoting sources close to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic .
" It is expected that ( their ) preventive detention will be lifted from next week and they will be returned to freedom , " the agency said .
Earlier on Thursday , France 's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news conference in Washington that the group might be freed in the next day or two .
Juppe said France had let it be known it would not accept this " parody of justice " and would not bargain for their freedom .
" If the news is confirmed , it would be the culmination of a daily effort by French diplomacy , " Juppe said .
The relief workers , members of a group called Premiere Urgence ( First Aid ) , have been held in a Serb prison since April 8 in the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica .
Clint steals show as Cannes festival opens
The 47th Cannes International Film Festival opened Thursday with jury president Clint Eastwood stealing the show even before the world 's biggest filmfest got under way .
As the the world 's cinema industry settled into its seats for the 12-day cinematic banquet , Eastwood dominated proceedings with his humour and incidentally with his love of music .
At the official inauguration ceremony at the Grand Theatre Lumiere in the Festival Palace here , French actress Juliette Binoche declared the festival open in a multi-lingual address reflecting the festival 's global stature .
Starting in Chinese and finishing in French , Binoche welcomed the movie industry to the French riviera . " I declare the 47th International Film Festival open , " she said , to loud applause .
But even before the ceremony Eastwood made Cannes ' day by pledging that the next 12 days should be for the average film-goer rather than art specialists or critics .
" I haven 't really done any studying for it because ... we 're going to be viewing strictly from an amateur point of view , " said the actor-turned director , presenting his jury to the press .
" Some of us may have have acted as critics at one point or another , but for the most part its just as film-goers , " he said .
And , breaking the ice at a press conference , he praised his vice-president , French actress Catherine Deneuve .
" She 's much prettier than Al Gore , " he said .
Then at the inaugural ceremony , hosted by Binoche 's compatriot , French actress Jeanne Moreau , Eastwood again stole the show when a " surprise " saxophone fanfare , including a serenade by saxophonist Archie Shepp , greeted his arrival on stage .
Eastwood , director of the 1988 hommage to Charlie Parker " Bird " and known for his love of jazz , looked suitably grateful , before helping Moreau welcome his eight jury members onto the stage .
The inaugural ceremony , broadcast live on French television , was followed by the premiere of the festival 's opening film , " The Hudsucker Proxy " by US filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen .
The brothers scored a hit in 1991 by taking the Palme d 'Or in their first appearance here with " Barton Fink . "
But they played down the prospect of a repeat performance , saying they were simply happy to have been invited back , with their latest offering , a romantic comedy set on Wall Street starring Tim Robbins and Paul Newman .
In all 23 films in the festival 's main competition are hoping to succeed Jane Campion 's " The Piano " and Chen Kaige 's " Farewell My Concubine " as winners of the Palme d 'Or on May 23 .
As well as the main competition , films are also being shown out of competition in categories called Un Certain Regard ( A Certain Regard ) , the Director 's Fortnight and the Camera D 'Or , for first-time filmmakers .
A retrospective of French film icon Jean Renoir has also been organized to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth , and a selection of the films of Federico Fellini is also on offer .
On Friday the competition proper gets under way with the French favourite " La Reine Margot " ( Queen Margot ) by Patrice Chereau , starring Isabelle Adjani , and " Du Li Sha Dai " ( Confuscius ' Confusion ) by Taiwan 's Edward Yang .
( new series ) North says it shot down southern warplane
Northern forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh said late Thursday they had shot down a southern warplane over the road to the stronghold of Aden .
A northern military spokesman told the official news agency SABA that northern troops had also launched a series of air raids against the airport in Ataq , in Shabwa province about 300 kilometres ( 180 miles ) east of Aden .
As the battle raged around the strategic town of Al Daleh , he said that northern forces had seized Soviet-built T-62 tanks in Abyan , southeast of Aden , as well as arms and ammunition from Al Daleh .
Earlier Information Minister Hassan Ahmed al-Lozi said : " The town of Al Daleh has fallen " to northern troops .
Aid officials in Aden said 60 families , numbering around 300 people , had arrived there after fleeing Al Daleh 90 kilometres ( 55 miles ) north of Aden , and were being housed in two schools .
As the two sides traded claim and counter-claim , Lozi said northern forces had captured a southern mechanised brigade based at Kharaz , about 130 kilometres ( 80 miles ) west of Aden .
But both reports were denied by the southern leadership in Aden , which said an offensive had been repelled and northern troops had been pushed back to Kataba , 10 kilometres ( six miles ) further to the north .
Southern spokesmen in Aden said they launched a counter attack and retook positions they had lost to their northern rivals .
Earlier Thursday southern forces said they had shot down three northern warplanes and sunk a warship in the Kharaz region near the strategic Bab el-Mandab Straits on the Red Sea .
Saleh 's General People 's Congress called on Yemenis to rally to " the side of legitimacy to scupper and condemn the crimes committed by the bloodied Baid " referring to ousted Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid .
In a communique published in Sanaa the GPC called on the Yemenis to " openly condemn the terrorist band and the traitors in the heart of the ( southern ) Yemen Socialist Party . "
The armies of the former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil war since last Thursday , shattering the uneasy four year union between the conservative north and Marxist south .
Meanwhile , the Arab League held a meeting with Yemeni leaders in Sanaa to try to broker a ceasefire between Saleh and Baid .
Their feud erupted into all-out war last Thursday , with southern air raids and Scud missile attacks on Sanaa and a northern offensive targeted on Aden .
Broadcasting death on TV to give meaning to life
A death row inmate wants the world to see his execution as he fights a warden 's order banning his death being broadcast on national television .
The televising of his death will bring meaning to his life , said convicted killer David Lawson .
It will also draw attention to the chronic depression he claims led hi8m to kill .
State officials said televising the death will make a spectacle of what should be regarded a somber event . A state supreme court judge is expected to rule on the issue shortly .
Lawson is slated for death on June 15 . He was convicted of murder when he shot a man during 1980 home break-in .
Execution in North Carolina is by gas or lethal injection . North Carolina has executed five people since resuming the death penalty in 1984 , all by injection . Lawson has until five days before his execution to decide which method he wants .
North Carolina bars cameras at executions , but allows five reporters , including one from television , to witness the deaths .
The event reopens debate on the issue . National talk show host Phil Donohue has joined Lawson in his request to the North Carolina Supreme Court to overturn the ban .
Attempts in 1991 by a California television station to show the gas-chamber death of an inmate failed when a judge ruled against the broadcast and ordered tapes of the death destroyed .
" It would only satisfy the thirst for vengeance that is unwarranted , " said George Gerbner , dean emeritus of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania .
" It 's a ghoulish spectacle that 's bound to have a brutalizing , desensitizing effect on a public already jaded by images of violence , " he added .
Secretary of Correction Franklin Freeman said the execution " should not be turned into a circus . "
He said the events surrounding the execution of serial killer John Wayne Gacy on Tuesday in Illinois demonstrate his point . People waited outside Gacy 's prison in a festive atmosphere , with vendors selling T-shirts saying " No Tears for the Clown . "
Gacy , a building contractor who often entertained at parties dressed as a clown , was executed for murdering 33 young men and boys during the 1970s .
" The conduct certain people exhibited there is an example of the kind of conduct that would be inspired by public broadcast of executions , " said Freeman .
He said televising the events would be the modern-day equivalent of public hangings which attracted hundreds of vendors and spectators before they were halted . The last public hanging in North Carolina took place in 1910 .
Lawson said the broadcast would highlight the plight of people who suffer from chronic depression . He said he was not aware he suffered from it until he was on Death Row .
" I 'm a human being and not a monster , " said Lawson Tuesday during an interview with NBC television .
" It 's all about making the whole story public in order to help somebody else who 's suffering , " said Marshall Dayan , Lawson 's attorney .
European title for Romania
Lavinia Milosovici , Gina Gogean , Nadia Hategan and Simona Amanar won the women 's title for Romania at the European team gymnastics championships here on Thursday .
Violence overshadows Dominican Republic elections by Arturo Gudino
Killings and threats of increased violence have overshadowed preparations for a presidential vote next week , even though the parties signed a civility pact to guarantee peace during the balloting .
Already around 30 people have died in political violence during street protests and rallies for the May 16 poll that pits President Joaquin Balaguer against Jose Francisco Pena Gomez , a black leader of the Democratic Revolutionary Party . Most recent surveys put them in a dead heat .
Also running is former president Juan Bosch of the Independent Revolutionary Party . Bosch was ousted in a 1965 coup .
Balaguer and Pena Gomez urged their supporters Thursday to refrain from violence during the final campaign events , which conclude Saturday . The two leading candidates signed a " Civility Pact " on Tuesday .
Despite plenty of election slogans there is in fact few differences between the candidates .
All praise current economic structural adjustment programs and plans to sell state enterprises pushed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank .
But the opposition has argued that 87-year-old Balaguer , who is nearly blind , is too old to remain president .
Both leading candidates have promised to create jobs for the estimated 30 percent of the economically active population that is out of work . Both have also promised higher salaries and improved access to education and health care .
The Dominican Republic 's 7.3 million people are about 15 percent white , 10 percent black and 75 percent mixed race . Per capital income is about 790 dollars annually while about 20 percent of the population is illiterate .
Some of the 2.5 million residents of the capital also began hoarding food in anticipation of demonstrations . " This is normal , they always do this , " one supermarket manager said . " People buy just in case , but that does not mean that there will be problems . "
Nerves were shaken when Jacinto Peinado , the vice president of the ruling Christian Social Reformist Party , said Wednesday that he had information that the opposition had plans to hold demonstrations on Monday afternoon to disrupt voting for president , 30 senators , 120 deputies and 103 mayors .
And the Democratic Revolutionary Party accused the ruling party of instructing its observers to contest the results of any voting stations where the opposition prevailed .
" The election will be clean and pure , " said Balaguer , who is seeking a third , four-year term . " It ( the pact ) will calm citizens frightened by disagreeable events . "
But the pact has not entirely calmed the nation 's nerves .
In a television appearance early Wednesday , Pena Gomez spokes ominously of plans by top military officers called Operation Scorpio that he declined to detail .
" I have information that Operation Scorpio expressed judgements that I do not want to repeat , " said Pena Gomez , who has pledged to improve the lot of the nation 's 23,000 soldiers .
Army spokesman said that soldiers would be in their barracks throughout the weekend unless needed to restore order .
In a four-paragraph statement released Thursday , the military chiefs of staff said : " The occasion has arisen to emphasize that public order will be maintained firmly and energetically , in obedience with democratic norms . "
The Organization of American States ( OAS ) has sent a team of 47 observers for the election .
Also as part of the pact , mediated by Roman Catholic church officials , parties promised to withdraw offensive campaign advertisements that have dominated this Caribbean nation 's campaign .
But as of midday Thursday they were still being broadcast on television and radio .
Dollar weakens in wait-and-see atmosphere
The dollar lost ground against the major currencies Thursday in New York exchange as traders awaited more data on inflation trends in the United States .
Gold fell 1.90 dollars from Wednesday 's closing price to 379.90 dollars an ounce .
Around 5 : 00 p.m. ( 2100 GMT ) , the dollar traded at 1.6675 German marks against 1.6690 marks late Wednesday and 104.22 yen against 104.30 .
The greenback also fell to 5.7200 French francs against 5.7250 Wednesday , 0.6669 pounds sterling from 0.6693 and 1.4245 Swiss francs against 1.4255 .
Jim Moore of American Security Bank said traders were awaiting a government report Friday on retail prices to get a better picture of inflation . A report Thursday showed wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in April .
Trading was light with the markets hesitant ahead of next Tuesday 's meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee , which could take action on short-term interest rates .
Double chasers ' small problem
Double chasers Manchester United are praying that small will not beautiful in Saturday 's FA Cup Final .
The English giants ' march towards their second successive league title was twice , if ultimately only temporarily , stopped in its tracks by Chelsea 's economy-sized strike force .
On both occasions , United 's normally unflappable centre backs , Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister , reminded one of those cartoon elephants who are scared stiff of mice , as they were spun one way and then another by the likes of Dennis Wise , John Spencer , Mark Stein and most notably , Gavin Peacock .
Peacock and Stein , in particular , will have good reason to approach with confidence an occasion for which many would rely on bravado .
The former , with his penetrating runs from deep positions , scored both goals in successive 1-0 victories at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford .
The latter , who made an unexpected return from injury to score the two goals that relegated Sheffield United last week , also hit a brace earlier in the season to give his former club , Stoke City , a 2-1 first-leg victory over United in the League Cup .
As a pair , they have that chalk and cheese factor that would do justice to a couple of buddy movie cops : Peacock , the clean-cut Christian with the college boy looks ; Stein , the callow ragamuffin , who has had to take the slow route to the top , weighed down , according to his first manager David Pleat , by the hefty chip on his shoulder .
His angry years at Luton , Queens Park Rangers , Oxford United and Stoke now apparently behind him , the Cape Town born striker afforded a refreshingly modest response to last week 's triumphant comeback .
" I would not say I have guaranteed my final place but I think I have given the gaffer a decision to make , " he said .
With Chelsea 's diminutive quartet having a relatively free role to harass United 's back four , heavy responsibility will fall on the anchor position in midfield .
Romantic as it may be to visualise the Blues ' player-manager Glenn Hoddle strutting the Cup Final stage for the fourth time , at 36 he would not relish the prospect of an afternoon chasing the deep shadows of United 's orchestrator Eric Cantona .
Much will be expected then of arguably Hoddle 's brightest young protege , Eddie Newton , who at 22 has the potential to join the England midfield dynasty of Robson , Platt and Ince .
Provided Cantona 's penetrative passing is not hindered by Wembley 's unseasonally long grass ( it is significant that the Frenchman has hit peak form on the worn end-of-season pitches ) and Giggs and Kanchelskis find the freedom to pit their wits against Clarke and Sinclair , it is reasonable to conclude that United can make it third time lucky .
Alex Ferguson side 's defeat at Stamford Bridge could easily have gone the other way , and the Old Trafford setback was the start of an early spring blip , now well behind them .
If Fergie fails to become the fourth double-winning manager this century , he will at least hope his decision to bring back goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel does not backfire on him .
The Dane 's fumbles at Wimbledon , and against Oldham in the FA Cup semi-final , not to mention his sentry-style reluctance to leave his posts on crosses , have been put into still more grim perspective by stand-in Gary Walsh 's confident handling in United 's last two matches against Southampton and Coventry .
United fans can only hope that Schmeichel 's assurances that he has recovered from his ankle injury are motivated more by conviction than by his desperation to make up for missing the League Cup final against Aston Villa through suspension .
Chelsea supporters will be encouraged by history , which , albeit marginally , weighs against United emulating Tottenham in 1961 , Arsenal in 1971 and Liverpool in 1986 by pulling off the double .
If United 's only uncapped player , Steve Bruce , does lift the Cup , manager Ferguson says the double will be dedicated to the club 's recently deceased patriarch , Sir Matt Busby , whose legendary " babes " failed in a similar quest in 1957 at the final hurdle against Aston Villa .
United themselves foiled domestic double chasing bids by Liverpool in 1977 and Everton in 1985 , with Cup Final victories . Liverpool failed again in 1988 when they were beaten at Wembley by Wimbledon .
Frank McLintock , Arsenal 's 1971 double-winning skipper , believes United will triumph , but he has warned them against what he calls the " Jack the Lad " syndrome .
The former Scotland defender said : " The important thing in a situation like this is to keep your feet on the ground and avoid thinking you are better than you really are .
" As soon as anyone does that they can get nailed . You can come unstuck . " Liverpool always had a knack of bringing people down to earth . We tried to copy it and it worked for us . "
McLintock recalled : " We had Charlie George , who in some ways was like Cantona .
" He could ping the ball 40 yards with the outside of his foot like a table tennis ball .
" But aspects like closing people down and denying opponents chances are just as important as the glitter of the game . "
Manchester United : Schmeichel ; Parker , Bruce , Pallister , Irwin ; Kanchelskis , Keane , Ince , Giggs ; Cantona , Hughes . Substitutes ; Walsh , two from McClair , Sharpe , Robson
Chelsea : Kharine ; Clarke , Johnsen , Kjeldbjerg , Sinclair ; Burley , Newton , Peacock , Wise ; Spencer , Stein . Substitutes ; Hitchcock , Hoddle , Cascarino
( new series ) Cheering crowds track down Jericho police by Nejla Sammakia
Hundreds of jubilant residents finally tracked down a vanguard of 20 Palestinian police officers as they waited outside Jericho Thursday ready to take over from the Israeli army .
Another 40 officers and 386 policemen , formerly based in Iraq , are due to follow Friday , as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4 .
Military sources said the officers will be part of the Jericho coordination office in charge of joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols in the area .
" If all goes well , all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by Friday afternoon , " said Colonel Herzl , a member of the commmittee whose full name was withheld for security reasons .
It was only after nightfall that residents finally managed to find the officers who were spending their first night in the West Bank in the shadow of the Jewish settlement Vered Jericho .
Many townspeople who had gathered earlier on the main road into Jericho to welcome the men had spent a frustrating day chasing around as the police were taken on a tour to inspect the Jericho region .
But despite the late hour more than 200 men , women and youngsters eventually turned out to give the officers a hero 's welcome .
The officers , new rifles hung across their shoulders embraced well-wishers , as women ululated with joy . The night promised to be long as more people heard of the officers ' arrival and drove up to the farm .
" We would have waited up all night to see them , " said Musbah Khalil , 25 .
" This is a golden moment . Now I really feel I 'm alive , not like before . "
General Yom Tov Samia , head of the Israeli delegation to the Israeli-Palestinian military liaison committee , said earlier there were still " details about security to sort out " after joint talks about the Israeli pullout .
But he added they had " studied the problem of joint patrols and we are ready to leave . "
The Palestinian officers , who were each given a Klashnikov or a Carl Gustav rifle on leaving the border , had lunched with senior Israeli officers , then inspected the 62 square kilometers ( 25 square miles ) that are to come under Palestinian autonomy .
The Israeli army is also redeploying in Gaza to protect the 4,000 settlers who remain there and pulled out of Rafah town earlier Thursday , where the first 300 police have already arrived .
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza and Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday .
" Our forces are ready to come immediately . Moreover we have the feeling that we are finally in our own country , " Yussef said .
Earlier a PLO official told AFP that more than 300 members of the new Palestinian police force bound for the Gaza Strip were stuck at the Rafah border terminal with Egypt .
He refused to elaborate on the delay , but said the Israelis had not handed out the application forms for identity cards for the men , ex-soldiers of the PLO 's Palestine Liberation Army .
But about 300 police crossed the Allenby Bridge from Jordan late Thursday and headed for the Gaza Strip via the West Bank and Israel , a Palestinian spokesman said in Amman
They will be the first armed Palestinians to cross Israeli territory under Israeli army escort .
Unlike the overcrowded Gaza Strip with its population of about 800,000 , the Jericho police are taking over a quiet oasis of 15,000 people , which is known as both the oldest and lowest town in the world .
Meanwhile , the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS shot and wounded an Israeli soldier and a truck driver in the first two attacks on the Gaza Strip since autonomy was launched a week ago .
Russian deputies go to China ahead of premier 's official visit
A group of Russian deputies led by Ivan Rybkin , president of the Duma , is to go to China Friday for a five-day official visit , a parliamentary spokesman said Thursday , quoted by the agency ITAR-TASS .
The delegation is to visit a metal works and the Shenzhen economic zone bordering Hong Kong , said Dmitri Biriokov , spokesman of the Duma or lower house .
The trip comes ahead of an official visit to China by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin later this month .
In Beijing , officials said Thursday that visit would take place on May 26 to 29 . In Moscow the premier 's office confirmed that Chernomyrdin would visit at the end of the month but did not give precise dates .
Corruption claims taint Spanish climax
Spanish football reaches boiling point this weekend as the last day proves decisive for the third year running amid rumours of corruption .
Deportivo La Coruna , at home to Valencia , are a point ahead of Johan Cruyff 's Barcelona , who entertain UEFA Cup hopefuls Sevilla at the Nou Camp stadium .
Spanish press is speculating over alleged handouts to Valencia players from mysterious Catalonian intermediaries . Two years ago press reports claimed Tenerife players were payed from a Barcelona source for their last-ditch home victory over Real Madrid which handed Barcelona the title .
History repeated itself last season when Tenerife beat Madrid , again on the last day , to bring Barcelona their third consecutive championship . And the press once again claimed Barcelona backers had made illicit payments .
Further controversy has come about over the timing of the matches of both Deportivo and Barcelona . The Spanish federation has brought forward those fixtures , and the Athletic Bilbao-Tenerife match to Saturday at 8 : 30pm ( 1830 GMT ) .
La Coruna president Cesar Augusto Lendoiro complained bitterly , saying Sunday tickets have been on sale for weeks .
Lendoiro agreed Barcelona should be able to alter their schedule because they play in the European Cup final against AC Milan in Athens next Wednesday .
But , realising Deportivo would have a distinct advantage should the Catalonians play a day earlier , Lendoiro has appealed to the Spanish federation , and may even resort to legal action .
Deportivo are understandably wary about any possible outside influences .
Deportivo have won nothing in their history while Barcelona have won 13 Spanish league championships , 22 Spanish Cups , plus eight European crowns .
Should Deportivo carry off the title , it will be mainly thanks to 16-goal Brazilian striker Bebeto , and the meanest defence in the league which has conceded just 18 goals in 37 matches .
Barcelona were boosted by the happy outcome to the kidnapping of Romario 's father which allowed the Brazilian to concentrate on football .
Rio de Janeiro police freed him after a massive manhunt lasting six days .
Benfica cross the city to Sporting Lisbon in a top-of-the-table clash in Portugal . Sporting , a point behind , will go top with four matches remaining if they win .
Bobby Robson 's Porto , three points behind Benfica , are away to sixth-placed Vitoria Guimaraes .
Montpellier , who knocked out Olympique Marseille on their way to the final , face Auxerre for the French Cup .
Montpellier beat Lens , conquerors of champions Paris St Germain , while Auxerre beat Nantes in the semi-finals .
Montpellier won the Cup at their first attempt in 1990 . Auxerre 's only appearance in the final was in 1979 when they were still in the second division . They lost to Nantes after extra-time .
Ekimov keeps firm grip on overall lead
Italian Andrea Peron won the eighth stage of the Tour DuPont cycle race on Thursday but Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov kept a 34-second lead in the overall standings .
Peron , a 1992 Olympic time-trial silver medallist , broke away in the last 15 kilometers to win the 201-km stage from Banner Elk , North Carolina , in five hours 35 minutes 47 seconds .
Briton Sean Yates was second in 5 : 36 : 37 and Djamolidin Abdujaparov of Uzbekistan was third in 5 : 36 : 39 .
Ekimov , the eight-time world track champion , finished eighth , in the same time as American Lance Armstrong , who remained second in the overall standings .
" We controlled the race from the start and I 'm satisfied , " said Ekimov . " But I don 't know about the time trial . Lance and I have the same chance to win , but it 's short and flat , so it looks like my race . "
Friday 's ninth stage takes the field 214 kilometers to Charlotte North Carolina .
The 12-day , 1,700-km race concludes Sunday in Winston-Salem , North Carolina .
Armstrong , the world road racing champion , admitted that he would have difficulty making up the gap to Ekimov , who is expected to dominate the closing time trial on Sunday .
" There is a 90 percent chance he is going to win , " Armstrong said . " My only opportunity is if he cracks or something else happens . "
Court hits sailor with maximum sentence for three million dollar rip off
The collapse of a three-million-dollar bogus billing scam landed a former naval chief petty officer in jail here Thursday .
James McGill , 53 , sobbed and apologized to his family as US District Judge John A. MacKenzie jailed him for seven years .
" I was selfish in what I did . I apologize to all of you , " said McGill .
Authorities indicted McGill in January on 430 counts of filing false claims , mail fraud , money laundering and tax evasion . He pleaded guilty in February under an agreement with the government .
McGill , who was a supply clerk with 22 years in the navy , used his knowledge of navy requistion methods to defraud the government . After leaving the navy in 1981 he joined the merchant marines on Military Sealift Command ships until he resigned in 1990 .
In 1989 he began a scheme lasting four years , submitting false claims to the navy for payment on supplies that were never ordered .
His ficticious company , Universal Supply and Services Inc . , took in over 3 million dollars from the navy . He received over 100 checks ranging from 7,400 dollars to 60,000 dollars .
The scam fell apart when someone noticed he submitted requests for a ship in storage .
McGill spent some of the money on gambling and opening a restaurant , but gave most of it away to his church and friends . He agreed to repay the remaining money .
Northern Iraq divided between rival Kurds after clashes kill 100 by Cristina Karrer
More than 100 people have been killed in the past two weeks in clashes between the two main Kurdish groups which have split northern Iraq , leaders from both sides said .
The fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK of Jalal Talabani ) and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan ( DPK of Massud Barzani ) ended early this week , they said .
The DPK has taken the control of the northwestern of Kurdistan around the town of Dahuk , while the PUK had seized the southeast , around Sulaymaniyah , an AFP correspondant said .
The two groups share with the Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) the province of Arbil in the middle of the Kurdish-controlled area of northern Iraq .
The INC , which says it represents all the Kurdish and Arab factions opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , brokered a ceasefire agreement on Sunday . It is based in Salaheddin near Arbil .
The fighting erupted after a private quarrel , the PUK said .
The only clause of the ceasefire so far implemented provides for INC militiamen to control checkpoints in the Arbil province , along with equal numbers of PUK and DPK fighters .
INC official Kanaan Makkiya told AFP Moslem Shiite fighters from southern Iraq were chosen to be deployed on the checkpoints .
The two remaining clauses of the May 8 agreement , that have not been yet implemented , provide for prisoner exchanges and the handing back of captured offices .
Makkiya said the PDK has given the INC , which is to supervise the prisoners exchange , a list of 93 people were being held by the PUK .
A DPK official denied his group attacked the PUK in Dahuk . " We only surrounded their offices to force them to surrender peacefully , " he told AFP .
PUK spokesman Mohammad Tufic said his faction " has taken over " the DPK offices in Sulaymaniyah only after its own offices in Dahuk were attacked .
Most of the casualties followed the PUK assault on Qalat Dizza and Raniya , near the Iranian border , on May 2 , sources from both parties said . Twelve were killed in Sulaymaniyah and 12 in Salaheddin .
The official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Monday that 2,800 were killed in the fighting .
Treasury , Federal Reserve near accord on reform of bank oversight system
The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have neared agreement on plans to merge the Fed and three government agencies to save money , said Fed Governor John LaWare Thursday .
The Treasury Department has estimated that the government could save 150 million to 200 million dollars annually and the banking industry about one million if the Federal Reserve is merged with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Office of Thrift Supervision and Comptroller of the Currency .
" There is substantially no difference between us and the Treasury on this , " said LaWare . " It 's really just technicalities . "
The Fed will continue to have oversight over 38 US banks under an accord that the Treasury Department has seemed amenable to .
LaWare also seemed optimistic that the US Congress would lift the 1927 MacFadden Act , which requires banks that want to do business in several states to set up wholly owned subsidiaries in each state in which they have branches .
The agreement , which has been approved by the Senate and House of Representatives , could go into effect before the end of the year .
The single difference between the two versions is the treatment of foreign banks , who have been asking for years to be given permission to operate here .
The senate would require them to create a US subsidiary while the House would give them equal treatment with US banks .
US banks are currently lobbying for legislation that would require their foreign competitors to set up subsidiaries here complete with boards of directors -- putting them on the same footing as US banks who want to engage in interstate trade .
The banks say that lifting the MacFadden Act would save 10 billion dollars annually and make banking easier for the 60 million Americans living near state borders .
LaWare also said he was opposed to a plan to strengthen regulations on derivative products , financial instruments such as futures or options .
" Derivatives are not new , not mysterious and if managed properly like any risk , not specifically dangerous , " he said .
The Fed has not taken an official position on the issue .
RAF planes airlift evacuees out of Sanaa by Laurence Peter
Foreign evacuees airlifted from Sanaa by the British Royal Air Force Thursday said people were deserting the capital of war-torn Yemen and shortages were worsening .
Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreigners , most of them British , to Cyprus from Sanaa . The evacuees , many looking exhausted , included babies and young children .
They spent about two hours at Larnaca airport before boarding a British Airways DC-10 plane bound for Gatwick airport , south of London .
Some had witnessed the fighting which erupted a week ago between northern and southern forces and were in Sanaa when a Scud missile slammed into a densely-populated area of the city Wednesday , causing at least 53 casualties .
Seventy-five evacuees arrived on one Hercules C-130 and 73 on the other . The planes had flown into Sanaa from Djibouti earlier Thursday .
The group included about 20 Americans , as well as some Dutch , New Zealanders , Swiss and Hungarians .
British construction worker Michael Wild said the blast from the Scud missile which hit Sanaa Wednesday shattered windows in the hotel where he was staying , 1,000 metres ( yards ) from the impact .
He quoted local Yemenis as saying 43 people were killed and 10 injured in the attack , which flattened eight houses . Many of the victims were children .
The official news agency SABA said Wednesday 25 civilians were killed by the Scud , fired by southern forces , and President Ali Abdallah Saleh put the overall casualty toll at 53 .
Wild added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party ( YSP ) building in the capital had been devastated in a northern attack and the Italian embassy was also hit .
A Hungarian neurosurgeon who asked to be not named said " medical supplies are extremely low " at the main Al-Thawra public hospital in Sanaa , where he had been working .
He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were barely functioning and virtually all the hospital 's foreign staff -- mostly Bulgarians and Indians -- had left .
About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few days ago .
The surgeon said some 15 Somali refugees caught in the crossfire were admitted with serious bullet wounds , and " at least two of them died later . "
The hospital was hit by electricity cuts and there was virtually no maintenance , he said .
One of the Hercules pilots , Flight Lieutenant Nick Young , said communications at Sanaa airport were " excellent " and praised the help offered by the Yemeni authorities .
He said he saw no damage to the airport , despite reported bombing raids by southern jets when the conflict erupted last week .
The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20 kilogrammes ( 44 pounds ) of luggage per person .
Yvonna Rienens , a Dutch teacher who was at an international school just outside Sanaa , said 150 of the 200 teachers and pupils at the school had already left .
She said she saw many Yemenis leaving Sanaa for villages outside the capital , some with their goats , and carrying only a few personal belongings , such as mattresses .
Oil engineers who were working for the US company Yemen Hunt Oil in the Marib field east of Sanaa said about 200 oil workers had stayed behind to keep operations at the field running . It produces up to 60,000 barrels of oil per day .
Some of them said Sanaa appeared to be a " ghost town , " with many shops closed and long queues at petrol stations .
Veronica Pickton , a British tourist from Basingstoke in southern England , said there were frequent electricity and water shortages at the hotel in Sanaa where she had been staying for a week . However , there were " no signs of panic " among local residents .
More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since fighting erupted .
Britain earlier organised an evacuation of 225 non-Britons from Sanaa .
Around 800 Britons , mostly oil workers , lived in Yemen before the civil war started . Some who were based around Aden , the southern capital , have already been evacuated by sea .
Former SAS man dies from bullet that wounded him 19 years before
A former member of the British elite SAS regiment died from the effects of a bullet wound he received nearly 19 years before , a coroner 's inquest found Thursday .
Sergeant-major Tony Fleming was wounded in 1975 while his unit was aiding the government of Oman against rebel forces . The bullet pierced his lung and lodged in his spinal column , leaving him paralysed from the chest down .
Doctors gave him 10 years to live at most but he survived for almost twice that , studying Arabic at university and returning to Oman to become a captain of the sultanate 's special forces .
He finally died of pneumonia in March after his condition suddenly deteriorated . The inquest was held to establish that he had died of wounds received on active service .
New Zealand Telecom announces 15 percent profit increase
Telecom New Zealand announced a profit Friday of 528.1 million NZ dollars ( 304 million US dollars ) for the year ended March 31 , up 15.4 percent from last year 's 457.7 million dollars , excluding abnormal restructuring costs .
Operating revenue was up 22.7 million dollars to 2.497 billion dollars . This compared with a 53.3 million dollar decline in revenue the previous year .
Telecom cut its employee numbers by 25 percent during the year . Telecom 's operating expenses for the year were down 64.7 million dollars to 1.612 billion dollars , excluding abnormal restructuring costs .
The majority owner of Telecom is a consortium made up of Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the United States .
Parliament to endorse provisional constitution before elections
Malawi 's provisional constitution will be voted into law by parliament before next week 's multi-party general elections .
Lovemore Munlo , chairman of the all-party National Consultative Council ( NCC ) which is overseeing Malawi 's transition to political pluralism , told journalists here Thursday that parliament is likely to meet May 15 to endorse the constitution .
Munlo , who is the country 's attorney-general and justice minister , said the constitution will come into force after the new government takes power after the May 17 polls .
He said a parliamentary committee will collect and examine the public 's comments and criticism of the provisional constitution , and a definitive basic law will be drawn up within a year .
Senate deals blow to Clinton with Bosnia vote
The Senate defied President Bill Clinton on Thursday by approving a measure that would require the United States to unilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia .
The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war .
Although the amendment , approved 50 to 49 , has little chance of becoming law , it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on resolving the conflict .
Clinton has pressed for a multilateral lifting of the embargo but has maintained that a unilateral effort by Washington could undermine other UN actions around the world .
" The president really understands the Senate sentiment here , " said White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers . " He has opposed the arm embargo in Bosnia from the beginning . We 've pursued other options and as a result we 've made some progress on the ground in Bosnia . "
But Myers said a unilateral lifting of the embargo could encourage other countries to ignore UN sanctions on Serbia , North Korea and other nations .
The measure goes to the House of Representatives , where it was expected to have little chance of passage . But even if it were approved , Clinton could veto the measure , and a two-thirds majority of both houses would be needed to override the veto .
Earlier , senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies to lift the embargo . By placing the two amendments in the same bill , senators appeared to give contradictory directives to the president .
" Lifting the arms embargo is the only feasible option that will permit the Bosnian government to defend itself , " said Senator Joseph Biden following the vote on the bill .
State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said earlier that passing the measure would be " problematic . "
He also suggested it would send a conflicting message to Geneva , where foreign ministers from Europe , Russia and the United States were to discuss the Balkan conflict Friday .
Europe and Russia have argued that an end to the arms embargo would escalate the fighting and quash any chance to resolve the conflict diplomatically .
At the United Nations a diplomat said that the Security Council was unlikely to approve a resolution lifting the embargo , noting that even if it had a majority among the 15 members Russia would be sure to veto it .
China 's UN representative , Chen Jian , said the US Senate action could create new problems .
" China is not in favor of measures which could escalate the war . We could judge against this background , " the Beijing diplomat said .
Last year , a resolution introduced at the UN by Moslem and non-aligned countries to exempt Bosnian Moslems from the sanctions won only six of the nine votes necessary to pass . Five non-aligned members and the United States supported the resolution .
Earlier Sadako Ogata , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , said that lifting the arms embargo would not help efforts to bring peace to Bosnia-Hercegovina after more than two years of brutal war .
" From a humanitarian point of view ... the number one objective I would like to see achieved is a ceasefire . Number two is a political settlement , " she said . " I hope all the meetings and decisions would lead to these two objectives . "
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic had appealed to members to pass the bill , and thanked Dole and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman for introducing it .
" The hopes of the Bosnian people are turned to the United States Senate , " he said recently .
Police arrest 50 after right-wing extremists chase foreigners
Police arrested some 50 people Thursday after right-wing youths armed with knives and sticks chased foreigners through the eastern German town of Magdeburg , injuring two of them seriously .
A 40-strong group of football fans attacked foreigners over several hours after parading through the town centre giving Nazi salutes , a police spokesman said .
" They indulged in a real hunt , " the spokesman said .
Three of the foreigners , whose nationality was not specified , received knife wounds and two were brought to a nearby hospital in a serious condition .
Two of the attackers were also lightly wounded and police were trying to determine whether a sixth person injured , a German , was one of the aggressors . A nightclub was seriously damaged during the fighting .
The extremists later attacked a cafe where their victims had taken shelter before more than 200 police arrived on the scene , arresting both extremists and foreigners , the spokesman said .
The entire police force had been placed on general alert during the rampage , he added .
Extreme-right violence caused 22 deaths in Germany last year compared to 15 in 1992 , but the number of attacks had dropped in the first few months of this year .
Kruk faces surgery for knee injury
Philadelphia first baseman John Kruk , who missed the first six games of the season after surgery to remove a cancerous testicle , will have an operation on his right knee on Friday .
Kruk will have arthoscopic surgery to remove loose cartilage from the joint .
He is expected to miss the next three weeks .
" I couldn 't move , I couldn 't run , " he said . " I wouldn 't say it was affecting the way I hit , but some people said I wasn 't coming through on my front side . "
Kruk has averaged .313 with one home run this year . He said the cancer and the knee problem had made it a tough season so far .
" I know my way around the hospital better than I do the stadium right now , " he said .
( new series ) Clinton refuses to rush court nomination
President Bill Clinton said will not rush into choosing his next nominee to the Supreme Court as he missed the Thursday target date he had set for the announcement .
The wait could signal a change in the Clinton 's choices , with the president possibly avoiding controversy over nominating Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to the post .
Clinton said Tuesday he would make an announcement by Thursday , but the only word Thursday was that he would hold off . He said he would resist " all the pressure of time deadlines . "
" On these matters , " Clinton said , " I tend to keep my own counsel more than on other things . ... It is one of the few things that the president just does on his own , of course ultimately with the advice and consent of the Senate . "
" I know that this has now become the most pressing story in the capital , but this is really a story that will have implications for years , indeed perhaps for decades to come , " Clinton added .
Clinton 's decision on his appointment to the highest court in the land is now expected by Friday , giving time for the Senate to confirm his choice before their summer recess .
Leaks -- particularly from senators consulted about possible candidates -- have indicated that Clinton has narrowed his choice to three names .
Named for life to the Supreme Court , the nine justices have a huge role in determining the course of American society .
In recent decades , the court has ended segregation , given blacks political power and legalized abortion , rulings which will have a lasting impact on the country .
Clinton 's hesitation is also due to the opposition the former Arizona governor might face in his confirmation hearings in the Senate , where his reputation as a staunch liberal and his political rather than legal background could be liabilities .
The 55-year-old Babbitt has riled several members with his zealous efforts to reform the government 's management of the country 's natural resources and his crusade to put environmental concerns ahead of economic interests .
The two other leading candidates are both judges . Richard Arnold , who is from Clinton 's home state Arkansas , and Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts , are both considered moderates .
" They would be slam dunks for the president , " and easily confirmed said Utah Senator Orrin Hatch , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee .
Arnold 's health problems are an issue and also working against him is his connection with Arkansas , where Clinton was governor . The White House wants to avoid any hint of influence peddling .
Clinton 's nominee will replace 85-year-old Justice Harry Blackmun who decided to resign after 24 years on the Supreme Court .
Clinton named his first Supreme Court justice last June : Ruth Bader Ginsburg , known as a moderate and an abortion rights advocate .
White House says US , France have " common approach " on Bosnia
The White House said Thursday that the United States and France had reached a " common approach " on Bosnia-Hercegovina , one day before a Geneva meeting on the former Yugoslav republic .
In a brief statement , the White House said that President Bill Clinton and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe " agreed the ministerial meeting offers as an important opportunity for the US , France and the international community to continue copperative efforts to press the parties to the conflict to negotiate a political settlement . "
Juppe arrived in Washington on Wednesday , determined to convince Washington to force Bosnia 's warring parties to agree to a peace plan .
" It is not a matter of imposing a peace plan on the parties that they don 't want but of putting pressure on them to accept it , " he said .
Clinton on the other hand , had backed a plan to convince Europe to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia 's Moslems .
Juppe met with the president at the Oval office early Thursday to discuss Bosnia .
Leaving the White House , Juppe said he was pleased with the " convergence " between Washington and Paris , but he also acknowledged that there were stil details to work out .
The Geneva conference Friday will bring together the foreign ministers of Britain , France , Germany , Russia and the United States , as well as Belgium and Greece .
Two Nigerian soldiers killed in clash with Cameroon
Two Nigerian soldiers were killed in the disputed Bakassi peninsula in an incident blamed on Cameroon , Nigerian television reported Thursday .
" Cameroon has once again confirmed that she is the aggressor , " armed forces spokesman Colonel Okon Ede was quoted as saying .
" While Nigeria has been playing the role of a good neighbour by resorting to diplomatic , political and traditional means to resolve the dispute , Cameroon has consistently displayed arrogant agression which resulted in the death of two Nigerian soldiers recently . "
Ede 's statement , which gave no further details of the incident , called on the international community to take note of " another veritable act of provocation " by Cameroon .
Earlier the official Nigerian news agency said head of state General Sani Abacha had held " crucial consultations " on national security with his armed forces chiefs Thursday in the capital Abuja .
The situation in Bakassi , an area rich in natural resources where the two sides have confronted each other since January , was one the agenda as well as political and economic conditions in Nigeria , the agency said .
Job cutting produces 15 percent profit lift for New Zealand Telecom
Telecom New Zealand Friday announced a profit of 528.1 million NZ dollars ( 304 million US ) for the year ended March 31 , up 15.4 percent from last year 's 457.7 million dollars , excluding abnormal restructuring costs .
As the result was announced an academic said Telecom was making too much money and might , as a result , attract attention from regulatory authorities .
Operating revenue was up 22.7 million dollars to 2.497 billion dollars . This compared with a 53.3 million dollars decline in revenue the previous year .
Telecom cut its employee numbers by 25 percent during the year . Telecom 's operating expenses for the year were down 64.7 million dollars to 1.612 billion dollars , excluding abnormal restructuring costs .
Staff shedding was reflected in gross personnel costs , which fell 11.6 percent over the year , and was the major factor in a 3.9 percent decline to 1.612 billion dollars in operating expenses .
At March 31 Telecom had 202 access lines per operating employee , compared with 142 a year earlier and 123 in March 1992 .
" The pace at which the number of personnel continues to decline will hinge largely on the introduction of new systems , the timing of which is difficult to forecast precisely , " chairman Peter Shirtcliffe and chief executive Roderick Deane said in their annual review .
About 1,000 more jobs are to be eliminated this financial year .
Meanwhile Victoria University professor of accounting Don Trow said Friday 's profit was too much for a near monopoly .
He said that if profits continued to grow , then the company is forecast to reach more than 680 million dollars within two years , and the regulatory Commerce Commission may be forced to consider the question of excessive profits .
The return works out to more than 20 percent on investment , the highest for any public company listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange . At 680 million dollars that return grows to 30 percent ; unheard of in a large company in a country with low inflation .
Once state owned , Telecom is now half owned by two American companies , Ameritech and Bell Atlantic , with the rest owned by small shareholders and New Zealand and overseas fund managers .
Trow said the profit return was very high for a utility with secure cash flows and profits unlikely to be badly affected by economic downturns .
He said Telecom was still in a position of substantial protection as its main competitor , Clear Communications , had not yet had the chance to provide effective competition in the local calling market .
Friday 's result show revenue growth of 22.7 million dollars or 0.9 percent compared with a 2.1 percent decline in the year ended March 1993 .
The number of telephone access lines grew 3.8 percent , national call volume 9.9 percent , international outward 11 percent and international inward 12.4 percent .
Directories and tariff revenue grew 13.1 percent and income from enhanced services 23.6 percent .
The average of both national and outward international call prices in March this year was around 15 percent lower than a year previously .
" The directors see significant prospects for growth in products and services based on the capabilities of Telecom 's intelligent network and modern transmission systems , " the annual review said .
" Market penetration and intensity of use of many of Telecom 's products and services , including toll calling , enhanced network services and mobile services , are still low compared with other countries , " it said .
Fittipaldi , Mercedes reign at Indy by Jim Slater
In 33 years of racing , Emerson Fittipaldi has never had an engine this good .
The reigning Indianapolis 500 champion gave the Mercedes power plant his ultimate praise here Thursday after driving his Penske car to the month 's fastest lap in practice for the 78th Indy race .
The Brazilian circled the 2.5-mile ( 4 km ) oval in 39.05 seconds at 230.438 mph ( 368.700 km / h ) . Fittipaldi reached a top speed of 245 mph ( 392 km / h ) .
" I 've never been 245 mph before in my life , " Fittipaldi said . " This is the limit . Oh my . That must be a lot in kilometers . I don 't want to even see it in kilometers . I 'll keep it in miles . "
Fittipaldi 's top speed replaced another Brazilian driver , Raul Boesel , atop the Indy practice speed list . Boesel 's best was 230.403 mph ( 368.644 km / h ) .
" We seem to be running in the same time slot more than anybody other than the Penskes , " Boesel said . " We have been consistent and we have a good balance on the car . "
Fittipaldi and his Mercedes-powered Roger Penske teammates , Al Unser Jnr and Canada 's Paul Tracy , are favorites in Saturday 's 100,000-dollar pole battle for the May 29 race . Fittipaldi won his only Indy pole in 1990 , one year after taking his first checkered flag at Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
The Mercedes engine , designed by English motormakers Mario Illien and Paul Morgan , takes advantage of extra boost allowed stock block engines . The rule was aimed at allowing low-budget teams to be competitive here , but Penske 's multi million-dollar investment in an engine legal only here has made his cars the ones to beat .
" The reality is there is much less of an advantage than people think , " Fittipaldi said .
The advantage is enough for Ford motor racing director Dan Rivard to seek relief from Indy race officials . Most contenders here use his Ford-Cosworth engines across the Indy circuit , but Penske could make them uncompetitive .
" We 're working with the speedway so we can all work with the same engineering , " Rivard said . " The speedway is faced with some very tough choices . They have to make the decision ( on changing rules to kill the Mercedes ) . "
Rivard and Cosworth 's Steve Miller both said they could build an Indy-only engine similar to Mercedes for next year if they must . New rivals Honda and Toyota would likely do the same .
" We 're not adversarial in this , but we want to know what 's going on , " Rivard said . " If the Penskes have any luck at all , they could be unstoppable . "
Even rivals agree the Mercedes drivers ae likely to break the track records set by Roberto Guerrero in 1992 . They are 232.482 mph ( 371.971 km / h ) for a four-lap average and 232.618 mph ( 372.188 km / h ) for a single lap .
" It 's going to be ludicrous . We 're here to qualify in the second or third row , " Britain 's Nigel Mansell said .
Unser , who has tested the Mercedes over 520 miles , dislikes the favored role , saying : " We 're not a lock for the pole . You can have all the horsepower and it won 't matter unless you can get around the corner . "
But his father , four-time Indy winner Al Unser Sr. , likes what he sees from his son 's engine .
" We know the engine is capable . Penske doesn 't let things sit back and relax , " he said . " Whether it will stand up on race day , nobody knows . I bet you it will be a strong motor all day , though . Penske wouldn 't come here without a good idea it would hold up . "
Lawyer was tortured to death : pathologist
A pro-Islamic lawyer , Abdel Hareth Madani , who died in prison last week , had been tortured to death , an official preliminary pathologist 's report has found .
The office of the state prosecutor said it had called for a final report and summoned the doctors who carried out the autopsy on Madani 's body for more information .
Prosecutor Raga 'a al-Arabi , who ordered the pathologist 's report , is also expected to interrogate the police suspected of involvement in torturing Madani .
Interior Minister General Hassan al-Alfi , questioned by journalists , said the matter was still being investigated and that the truth would be made public .
The Cairo Bar said Monday that Madani 's death , notified to his family the previous Friday , was premeditated murder , while Egyptian and foreign human rights organisations called on President Hosni Mubarak to clear up the matter .
Madani was arrested on April 26 and taken away to an unknown destination . The opposition said he had been trying to mediate between the government and Islamic fundamentalists in the conflict which has killed some 400 people in the past two years .
Three Latin American countries clear way for trade pact
Colombia , Venezuela and Mexico cleared the way Thursday for a three-way free trade agreement after settling several longstanding differences , officials said .
In statements issued here as well as Caracas and Mexico City , the three governments said the Group of Three treaty would be signed at the June 15 Latin American summit in the Colombian capital and would go into effect January 1 .
" This is a historic accord , the second most important in America , " said Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Rafael Santos , saying the pact was second in importance only to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada , Mexico and the United States .
Santos called the measure a definitive step toward the political integration of Latin America .
To reach agreement , officials decided to exclude Venezuela from textile and apparel , Santos said , adding that treatment of the petrochemical sector was handled on a product-by-product basis .
" We could not allow several differnces in secondary matters to sidetrack this accord , " Santos said .
Dollar opens at 104.15 yen in Tokyo
The dollar opened at 104.15 yen in Tokyo on Friday , up 0.05 yen from the previous day 's finish of 104.10 yen .
The opening rate was slightly below New York 's late Thursday quote of 104.22 yen .
Multiple executions a hit with state officials
Reduced costs and less stress are making state officials consider more multiple executions after putting two prisoners to death earlier in the week .
" The attorney general is talking to us now about the next multiple execution , " said Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Alan Ables Thursday .
Convicted murderers Jonas Whitmore and Edward Charles Pickens died by lethal injection Wednesday within about an hour of each other in the same chamber .
Ables said more than one execution on one day saves money spent on preparations and overtime .
He also said prison workers face less stress with multiple executions . " Nobody wants to get up in the morning and go kill somebody , " said Ables .
Two or more executions on the same date " would lessen that anxiety that the officers are faced with , " said Jim Clark , president of the International Association of Correctional Officers in Washington .
" It should save the taxpayers a considerable amount of money and we certainly encourage multiple executions , " said Dennis Martin , executive director of the National Association of Chiefs of Police .
Arkansas called in 32 extra state police to the prison Wednesday night along with over 45 other people not normally on duty .
Multiple executions were once common in the United States . Arkansas executed two people on four separate dates in 1960 . Until Wednesday , no multiple executions had taken place in the United States since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 .
Executions are are becoming more frequent with prisoners convicted since 1976 reaching the end of their appeals . Whitmore and Pickens brought the death total to 239 since 1977 . More than 2,800 people are sitting on Death Row in the United States .
The next multiple execution in Arkansas could take place in July or August , said Ables . The state has 41 inmates on Death Row .
( picture ) Chinese dissidents in US favor partial revoking of MFN
Chinese dissidents in the United States generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing 's privileged trading status targeting state-owned firms , not complete revocation , dissident leaders said here Thursday .
There are differing views among the dissident community in the United States on the best way to advance human rights in China , but " an overwhelming majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted revocation , " Zhao Haiching , the president of the National Council for Chinese Affairs ( NCCA ) told a press conference .
China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if he were to extend Beijing 's most favored nation ( MFN ) trading status beyond June 3 , Zhao said .
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the government 's intransigence , said Zhao , whose group coordinates dissident groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China .
Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its human rights record , while not punishing the private sector and market economy which everybody wants to promote , Zhao said .
Zhao also said it was the United States 's own fault that its decision to firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit .
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China " that all they have to do to win MFN is play tough , and they have been doing so , " Zhao said .
Economic officials in the government made it clear early that evoking human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States .
Chinese dissident Wang Juntao , jailed for his part in the 1989 pro-democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square massacre , is in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US officials .
Wang said that his release was a miracle , but urged the international community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in China . On Wedenesday , Wang called for Washington to aintain pressure on China but not by withdrawing MFN
Wang met for half an hour at the White House with national security adviser Anthony Lake , with no details available from the talks , officials said .
Woody Allen loses latest custody battle
New York 's Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision Thursday denying film star Woody Allen custody of three children in a bitter court battle with his ex-lover and former leading lady Mia Farrow .
The court also ordered Allen to pay 1.2 million dollars to cover Farrow 's legal expenses in the dispute over the couple 's six-year-old biological son , Satchel as well as two children adopted by the couple .
Elkan Abramowitz , Allen 's lawyer , said the film director and actor was " bitterly disappointed " by the ruling and said he may seek further appeals .
The appeals court ruled that Allen , who acknowledged sleeping with Soon-Yi Previn , Farrow 's 22-year-old adopted daughter , showed " an absence of any parenting skill . "
The court maintained an order barring Allen from visiting seven-year-old Dylan and 16-year-old Moses , who were adopted by the couple during their relationship that ended in 1992 .
Allen was cleared of Farrow 's accusations that he molested Dylan .
Wild , windy day for LPGA
Rain , lightning and wild winds wreaked havoc on the LPGA Championship Thursday , leaving two golfers , Alice Ritzman and Dottie Mochrie , sharing the lead with three still stranded on the course .
Ritzman has never won a tournament in 17 years on the LPGA Tour . She carded a three-under 68 to share the lead with Dottie Mochrie , on a day in which only 16 of 141 golfers carded par or better .
Golfers with early tee times played in the rain . Later thunderstorms stopped play for two hours , and after the break strong , chilly winds caused scores to balloon .
" I kind of weathered the storm , " said Mochrie , who was on the last hole when play was suspended . " It wasn 't an easy day to play . "
France 's Anne-Marie Palli was disqualified for practicing during the rain delay . Three other golfers withdrew : Nancy Lopez with a lower back injury , Spain 's Tania Abitbol with a wrist problem and Sandra Palmer after allergies contributed to a disappointing 40 on her first nine holes .
Lopez , winner of three LPGA Championships , said she did not want to jeopardize her season by playing through the injury .
" It was useless , " said Lopez , who started on teh back nine with a bogey and double bogey . " If I did keep swinging , it could have gotten worse . I want to finish the rest of the year . "
Mochrie remained steady in the face of the upheaval . She made 15 pars , with birdies at five , 12 , and 15 .
" I think I played three different courses , " she said . " The first holes in downpour , then the wind , and then the storm . With all that , I 'm pleased with the way I played . "
Ritzman , 42 , got to 68 in different fashion . Opening on the back nine she birdied the 11th and bogeyed the next from less than two feet .
She chipped in from 69 feet for a birdie at 17 , and added three birdies and a bogey on the front nine .
" The wind was strong and gusting , " she said . " The conditions were pretty tough . You had to maintain your patience to get the job done . "
Juli Inkster and Noelle Daghe were one shot behind the leaders , and England 's Laura Davies was in a group of five on 70 .
The three players still on the course when darkness fell were to complete the round Friday morning .
Clinton presses Senate to ratify landmine restrictions
The Senate should approve a 14-year-old treaty to curb millions of landmines from being layed around world said President Clinton Thursday .
Senate ratification would be " a matter of humanity , common sense and sound military doctrine , " Clinton said .
International representatives concluded the original agreement in Geneva in the fall of 1980 . The United States signed on in 1982 . Since then the treaty has languished , the subject of multiple US government reviews .
More than 100 million landmines lie unexploded in at least 62 countries , human rights groups reported . They also said worldwide production may be reaching 10 million anti-personnel landmines annually . The American Red Cross reported landmines kill more than 200 civilians every week .
Landmines are a particular threat in Afghanistan , Angola , and Cambodia .
Clinton termed the treaty " a modest but significant humanitarian effort to protect the victims of armed conflict from the effects of particular weapons . "
He also said ratification would strengthen US efforts urging an international moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines .
State Department and United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees personnel will testify before the Senate Friday on the issue .

Purchasing power of US households has been rising and will continue to rise through the year 2000 , the Conference Board business research organization said Thursday .
Between 1960 and 1990 , real per capita income doubled from 8,000 dollars to 16,000 dollars a year , the board said .
" Frequent predictions of an emerging decline in US living standards have little basis in fact , " said Conference Board director Fabian Linden .
The survey found that a growing number of US households are joining the middle class and that the 35-55 age group would soon control half the nation 's purchasing power .
The survey predicted that the number of households with an income level of between 50,000 and 100,000 dollars annually will likely grow by one-third by the end of the century and that the number of households earning more than 100,000 dollars would jump 80 percent .
Increased worker productivity , the greater participation of women in the work force and increased levels of education were cited as factors for the increase in purchasing power .
Eleven dead in foiled Colombian bank robbery
Nine alleged bank robbers and two bystanders were killed when police foiled a bank robbery early Thursday , leaving bodies strewn along a five-block stretch of road , authorities said .
The bank robbers entered a Banco de Colombia branch and took about 20,000 dollars before they were surprised by police .
Police and the alleged bank robbers exchanged fire , and the nine were shot and killed as they attempted to flee .
The dead included two passersby : a taxi driver allegedly shot by the bank robbers as they attempted to steal his vehicle and a bystander , police spokesmen said .
Pioneer psychoanalyst Erik Erikson who widened the scope of psychoanalytic theory to take greater account of social , cultural and other environmental factors , died Thursday . He was 91 .
Erikson died at the Rosewood Manor Nursing Home , said Diana Eck , a Harvard professor and friend .
" As they used to say of Gandhi , he was a mahatma , a great soul , very wise , very wide-ranging humanist and someone who really illuminated the stages of the life cycle from birth to death , " Eck said .
Erikson trained under Anna Freud -- the daughter of Sigmund Freud --specializing in child pyschology . Erikson graduated from the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute .
He extended Freudian theory into adolescence and adulthood and coined the phrase , " identity crisis . "
He wrote numerous books on human development and was recognized in his field as a pioneer . His most influential book was " Childhood and Society " ( 1950 ) .
His psychohistorical studies , " Young Man Luther " ( 1958 ) and " Gandhi 's Truth " ( 1969 ) , explored the convergence of personal development and social history . The latter won the Pulitzer and National Book Award in 1970 . Later works dealt with ethical concerns in the modern world .
In addition to psychoanalytic works , Erikson also wrote biographies of Jesus , Albert Einstein , William James and Charles Darwin .
Born in Frankfurt am Main , Germany on June 15 , 1902 to Danish parents , Erikson left Europe for the United States in 1933 . He became a naturalized US citizen in 1939 .
Erikson taught at Harvard University in the mid-1930s and returned during the 1960s . He was professor emeritus of human development and psychiatry at Harvard .
In his last years he had been living at the nursing home . His wife , Joan , lived nearby .
Diplomats prepare to meet in disarray on Bosnia crisis
Diplomats from Europe , Russia and the United States prepared to meet here Friday amid disarray for yet another attempt to get to grips with the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina .
A senior US official said the aim was to " focus on cessation of hostilities linked with an early resumption of negotiations " between the Bosnian Serbs and the recently-agreed Moslem-Croat federation .
But he acknowledged that the Serbs were demanding a lifting of UN sanctions against their backers in the rump Yugoslavia before they would return to the negotiating table , something which the United States opposes .
Washington , represented by Secretary of State Warren Christopher , also went into the talks embarrassed by a vote Thursday by the US Senate that the administration should unilaterally allow US arms shipments to the mainly-Moslem Bosnian government in defiance of a 1991 UN embargo .
US President Bill Clinton favours lifting the embargo to allow the government forces to defend themselves , but says it must be a multilateral move . The Senate vote , while having virtually no chance of becoming law , undercut him the day before the Geneva talks .
Friday 's conference also follows strong words from France that it might be obliged to pull its forces out of the UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia if peace can not be obtained , and continuing disagreement over how territory might be divided among the warring sides .
But despite earlier pessimism from Washington , the US official here said it was " possible to a large extent " to " agree on some kind of approach " towards resolving the problem .
He said that both sides had indicated interest in a cessation of hostilities , the Serbs because of the 70 percent of Bosnia they controlled was " more they can effectively occupy , " and the Sarajevo government because it wanted to " calm things down in the hope negotiations resume . "
The official said the Geneva conference should also reaffirm support for decisions on the six UN-declared safe areas and prevent offensive actions elsewhere .
On Thursday fighting was reported at Tuzla and Bihac , both declared safe areas , and at Brcko , a potential flashpoint , while a UN military observer was killed and another seriously wounded on the edge of the Sarajevo exclusion zone .
UN Secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali called Thursday in a statement published in New York for the boundaries of the safe areas , where Moslems are under siege from Serbs , to be clearly defined .
He also ruled out extending the safe areas , for example to Brcko , saying the UN Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) did not have the resources to cover them .
" It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina , which requires a political and territorial solution , " Boutros-Ghali added .
The UN chief met in Paris Thursday with civilian and military chiefs operating in the former Yugoslavia , including special representative Yasushi Akashi , UNPROFOR commander General Bertrand de Lapresle , peace negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg and his European Union colleague Lord Owen .
The meeting covered Stoltenberg and Owen 's mandate for the Geneva talks , as well as ways of improving communications between UNPROFOR , Boutros-Ghali and the UN Security Council .
A communique said the UN wanted to see the participants at Geneva agree at least on the need to establish a general ceasefire in Bosnia as soon as possible and to deal with the whole problem of the conflict on a global and not a piecemeal basis .
Questioned on the possibility of lifting UN sanctions against Belgrade , held responsible for inciting the conflict , to encourage the Serbs to return to the negotiating table , the US official said this could begin once the Serbs had made a verified withdrawal of their forces to agreed lines .
As well as Christopher , Owen and Stoltenberg , the Geneva conference brings together the foreign ministers of Russia and five from the European Union : Britain and France which have the largest contingents of peacekeepers in Bosnia , current president of the council of ministers Greece , its predecessor Belgium and its successor Germany .
Saturday sees the signature of the agreement between Bosnian Croats and Moslems on their federation , which the Serbs have refused to join . The federation has also caused unease by claiming 58 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina , more than the Geneva participants have been prepared to agree .
Japan beat USA in women 's volleyball clash
Japan 's women 's volleyball team launched their tour of the United States with a 3-0 victory Thursday night , taking their record against the Americans to 88-57 .
Japan cruised to a 15-5 , 15-10 , 15-5 sweep in front of about 3,000 fans .
Mika Yamauchi led Japan with 19 kills and two blocks . Teammate Kazuyo Matsukawa added 12 kills and five blocks in the winning effort .

Eight die in Thai furniture factory fire
Six adults and two children died early Friday when fire swept through a furniture factory and salesroom in northern Bangkok , trapping the victims in their second-storey living quarters , police said .
Iron grilles on doors and windows prevented the victims from escaping the blaze , police said .
Radio reports said 10 workers managed to escape , but police could not immediately confirm the figure .
The cause of the fire , which broke out at around 1 : 30 a.m. and raged for over an hour , was under investigation , police said .
Thailand to show " Schindler 's List " uncut
The film censorship board has decided that the Oscar-winning film " Schindler 's List " may be shown uncut in Thai theaters despite nude love-making scenes which contravene local regulations .
The board voted Thursday to lift a ban imposed earlier this month , and the film will be shown for the first time in Bangkok Saturday , a spokesman for distributors United International Pictures , Surachit Chanowan , said .
In a 6-4 vote after hours of debate , the board decided that a 10-second nude sex scene was not after all objectionable as no sex organs were shown and it did not provoke sexual excitement , a police official told AFP Friday .
The official noted that board members voting against showing the film uncut included the press association , despite recent calls in the local press to update Thailand 's 1920s-era censorship regulations .
Others voting against represented the defense ministry , the national intelligence agency and the Thai movie confederation , the official said .
Steven Spielberg 's epic of a German industrialist who smuggles more than 1,000 Jews to safety during World War II , winner of seven Academy Awards , ran into trouble in several countries when Spielberg refused to allow any cuts .
Malaysia banned " Schindler 's List , " then grudgingly relented . The Philippines censorship board voted to cut certain scenes until President Fidel Ramos issued a decree to show the film in its entirety .
Indonesia , where some Moslem organizations contend the film demonstrates morals and actions which run counter to the Indonesian way of life , remains undecided .
In Thailand , where explicit sex shows can be seen in many night spots , films are routinely cut to meet censorship standards or a 90-minute time frame . Scenes of violence generally escape the cuts , but scenes with nudity do not .
Another Oscar-winning film now making the rounds in Bangkok , " The Piano " , is being shown at its full length , but with scenes involving nudity smeared into obscurity with petroleum jelly .
Atlanta bounce back in NBA playoffs
The Atlanta Hawks held Indiana to the lowest points total ever in a National Basketball Association playoff game Thursday , leveling their second-round series 1-1 with a 92-69 victory .
The Pacers ' 69 points were one less than the previous playoff low of 70 , set by Golden State against Los Angeles in 1973 and matched by Seattle against Houston in 1982 .
Atlanta 's Mookie Blaylock posted 11 points , 13 assists and 10 rebounds -- hitting double digits in all three categories for the fourth time in his career .
Atlanta led by as much as 61-42 at one point in the third quarter . Indiana narrowed the gap to 65-57 but could not come any closer .
The Hawks led from late in the first quarter , when Kevin Willis ' shot from the corner broke a 19-19 tie . Atlanta led 47-32 at halftime .
The best-of-seven series moves to Indianapolis , Indiana , for game three on Saturday .
Venezuelan Supreme Court clears way for former president 's trial
Venezuela 's Supreme Court cleared the way Thursday for a second set of charges to be filed against former president Jaime Lusinchi ( 1984-1989 ) , chief justice Roberto Yepez Boscan announced .
The high court found that there was enough evidence to try Lusinchi , a social democrat , for misappropriation of funds from the National Institute of Racecourses , an agency to manage racetracks .
The next step would be for the court to ask congress to lift Lusinchi 's presidential immunity , said Yepez Boscan . Lusinchi , like all ex-presidents , has a lifetime seat in the senate .
The Supreme Court ruled in August that there was enough evidence to try Lusinchi for corruption in his handling of other state funds . That trial is now in " judicial limbo , " said Lusinchi 's lawyer , Morris Sierralta .
Lusinchi is currently in Boston , Massachusetts , according to his attorney .
Jiang invokes Tiananmen massacre in warning on unrest
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has issued an ominous warning that stability will be maintained at any cost , defending the bloody suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy movement just weeks before its fifth anniversary .
Without the " resolute measures " taken by the army on June 4 , China would not enjoy its current stability , said Jiang , whose remarks were carried on state-run radio and the front pages of all major newspapers Friday .
By invoking the memory of June 4 , Jiang has issued the strongest warning to date that the government is willing to take all measures necessary -- including military force -- to eliminate any perceived threat to its position .
Since the beginning of the year , Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed the paramount importance of stability and their rhetoric has been backed up by widespread arrests of dissidents and a law and order crackdown that has seen a sharp increase in executions .
Jiang made the comments during a meeting here Thursday with visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammad .
" A bad thing has been turned into a good thing , " Jiang said , referring to the 1989 unrest that at its height saw upwards of one million people taking to the streets of Beijing in a single day .
" As a result , our reform and opening programme has forged ahead with steadier , better and even quicker steps , and our advantages have been brought into fuller play , " Jiang said .
Jiang was communist party chief in Shanghai at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre and consequently emerged untainted by its bloody aftermath , which makes his unequivocal endorsement of the military supression all the more significant .
As well as the presidency , Jiang currently hold the posts of Communist Party secretary general and chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission .
Israeli officials handed over at least three buildings to Palestinian police officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on .
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the central police station , the post office and a court house . The sites were transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed over from Jordan on Thursday .
Palestinian police take over buildings in Jericho
Israeli officials handed over at least three buildings to Palestinian police officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on .
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the central police station , the post office and a court house , witnesses said .
The sites were transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed over from Jordan on Thursday .
Another 40 officers and 386 policemen , formerly based in Iraq , are due to follow on Friday , as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4 .
" If all goes well , all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by Friday afternoon , " said Colonel Herzl , a member of the Israeli-Palestinian military liaison commmittee , whose full name was withheld for security reasons .
" I didn 't expect them to hand over the sites this quiet way , " said taxi-driver Attia Barham , 40 .
" But there have been so many changes in plans that I 'm not surprised .
" The Israelis saw how happy we were and didn 't want to let us rejoice , " he said , referring to the discreet way the officers were let in to the region .
Nuclear , missile issues loom large on Indian PM 's US trip by M.R. Narayan Swamy
India 's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes will top Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao 's agenda on his visit to the United States , his most controversial foreign trip in three years in office .
The 73-year-old Indian leader , who embarks on the visit Saturday , is under tremendous domestic pressure to stand up to persistent US demands to cap the country 's nuclear regime and freeze its missile defence programme .
Opposition leaders have urged him to call off the visit to denounce what they describe as US arm-twisting over the nuclear issue , Kashmir , human rights and trade .
No overseas visit by Rao has generated so much heat and controversy .
Both Indian officials and US diplomats admit that the two countries have never been so far apart on crucial policy issues , but emphasise that the trip is nevertheless important to set the course for future ties .
" There are some issues on which we agree , there are some on which we have differences , " a US diplomat here said , underlining the growing chasm . " We shall try to find a common agenda . "
On Thursday , Rao indicated that a common ground would be hard to find when he vowed not to roll back India 's nuclear and missile policies under pressure from Washington .
" A leader would be worthless if he changes government policies during his visits to a foreign country , " he told a meeting of MPs from his ruling Congress ( I ) party .
Rao is under widespread attack that he has already bowed to Washington by postponing the final trial of India 's surface-to-surface Prithvi missile that had been scheduled for Saturday .
A day 's secret talks between Indian and US officials in London last month on the nuclear programme added to rumours that Rao may be quietly preparing to surrender India 's nuclear option .
Commentator Nikhil Chakravarty said on Thursday in an article titled " Mr. Rao , go to Washington but go with dignity " that the week-long visit " looks as onerous as climbing Mount Everest . "
At the root of Indo-US differences is the refusal by New Delhi , which exploded a nuclear device in 1974 , to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) or agree to a pact on a nuclear-free South Asia .
Indian officials with an eye on China say any attempt at nuclear disarmament should be global and not restricted to a region .
The US administration , which fears that South Asia is a potential nuclear flashpoint , also wants New Delhi not to induct the Prithvi missile into the army , and to halt research on the intermediate-range Agni ballistic missile .
The demands , on top of statements by US officials seen here as tacitly encouraging the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir , have angered many in India , where the US is still widely seen as pro-Pakistan .
A US proposal to supply 38 F-16 planes to Pakistan , with which India has fought three wars and which it accuses of backing Moslem separatism in Kashmir , has added to the list of irritants .
The strains were evident on May 7 when the Indian foreign ministry , in a move unprecedented ahead of a prime minister 's visit , lashed out at Washington .
" India is equally disappointed that the US approach has not accepted India 's position ( on nuclear non-proliferation ) and persists with its ' all-or-nothing ' approach , " a spokesman said .
The American attempt to cap the country 's nuclear program " is bound to fail , " said Brajesh Mishra of the oppostion Indian 's People 's Party . " The prime minister is in no position to compromise in view of the overwhelming mood in the country . "
Amid the fireworks , Indian officials say they will try to sell New Delhi 's three-year-old economic reforms which have made the country an attractive investment centre , in particular for US companies .
Independent unions wary of army 's new activist role by Pascal Mallet
Indonesian dissidents are either worried or outright indignant over this week 's announcement that state security forces would become more involved in labour disputes .
The head of the army 's powerful social and political division , General Hartono , announced that the National Coordinating Agency for the Maintenance of National Stability ( Bakorstanas ) would become involved in social conflicts from their outset to prevent them from spinning out of control .
In mid-April , strikes in the North Sumatran city of Medan degenerated into demonstrations against the country 's ethnic Chinese , in which one person was killed amidst widespread property damage .
On Tuesday Hartono criticised Indonesia 's official trade union , the SPSI ( Indonesian Workers Union ) , saying it had failed in its mission to defend the country 's workers .
His remarks were not welcomed by the president of the independent Prosperity union ( officially called the SBSI ) , Mukhtar Pakpahan : " I think this move will not overcome the problem . The root of the labour dispute in Indonesia is because there is no freedom for workers to organise themselves , " he said .
" This involvement by Bakorstanas or the army is a step backwards , " he added .
Founded in 1992 , Prosperity is not recognised by the government , which prefers to deal with the official SPSI only .
Accused by the army of being behind the rioting in Medan , Prosperity has seen its freedom of movement further curtailed ever since . Three of its local officials have been arrested , and another twenty activists have been detained .
" The move is also against our law . Even the ministerial decree which allows the intervention of the military to a labour dispute has been scrapped by the introduction of new ministerial decree number 15 / 1994 at the beginning of the year , " Pakpahan said .
" It will also protect the interest of the businessman and it leads to a militarisation , " he said .
The new measure was also denounced by the co-founder of another independent union , " Solidarity " ( Setiakawan ) -- older than Prosperity but now lapsed -- human rights activist Johanes Princen .
" In the first place , the army should lower the informal cost that you have to pay to the manpower ministry , the military , the police , the mayor of the city , the people of the industry ministry , etcetera , " he said , alluding to what he says are the numerous bribes employers have to pay the authorities here .
" We all know that it does exist , " he said . " The informal costs have to disappear . The profit could then go in part to the labour . "
Hartono defended the new involvement of Bakorstanas , calling it part of a legitimate concern for the stability of the country .
" If they are not coordinated from the outset , social problems could increase and get out of hand ... they could become violent and then require even more difficult measures , " he said .
Observers here said that Hartono 's carefully prepared remarks , which were read to a seminar here and then given widespread publicity in the national media the next day , were a reflection of the military establishment 's concern with the subject .
The Medan demonstrators were demanding to be paid minimum wage , which is around the equivalent of 1.50 dollars a day . But many employers ignore the law , even according to the government of president Suharto .
Singapore hangs six Malaysians for drug trafficking
Six Malaysians were hanged here Friday for drug trafficking , Singapore 's Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB ) said .
The six , convicted of trafficking cannabis and heroin and helping others to do so , went to the gallows at Singapore 's Changi Prison at dawn .
Under local laws , the death sentence is mandatory for those convicted of trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin , 500 grams of cannabis or abetting in such offences .
Almost similar laws are enforced in Malaysia .
The CNB said that the hangings raised to 59 the number of people executed for drug-related offences under Singapore 's Misuse of Drugs Act which introduced the death penalty for trafficking in 1975 .
Australia to train Vietnamese pilots
Australia announced Friday it had won a multi-million dollar contract to train 60 Vietnamese pilots to aid that country 's air safety and tourism .
The two-year nine-million-Australian-dollar ( 6.5-million-US ) contract was sealed by national flag-carrier Qantas and the Australian Aviation College of Adelaide , South Australia .
" This is a tremendous boost for Australia 's aviation industry and for South Australia , " said Gordon Bilney , minister for development cooperation .
" This project will raise the Australian aviation industry 's international profile , especially in Southeast Asia , one of the world 's most important emerging markets . "
Training would boost Vientamese air safety and tourism , Bilney said in a statement .
Vietnam planned to upgrade its current fleet of aging Soviet aircraft and leased modern aircraft from Western countries , Bilney said , and wanted to train its own pilots to take over from those currently on contract from overseas .
The aviation college had already trained 677 pilots of whom 570 were from developing countries including China , Malaysia , Indonesia , Papua New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , South Korea and Oman .
The first Vietnamese trainee pilots were due to arrive in June .
Finance minister denies G7 ' secret ' accord to halt dollar 's reduction
Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii denied Friday a news report that a " secret accord " to stop the dollar 's fall had been reached late April at a meeting of central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of Seven ( G7 ) .
" There was no such accord , " Fujii told a scheduled press conference .
Quoting unidentified international financial sources , the Mainichi newspaper said Friday that the G7 agreed at the meeting in Washington to maintain the dollar above the " psychologically important " 100-yen line against the yen .
They decided to take action together to defend the dollar , partly in response to a strong US request , the daily said .
Commenting on the currently stable dollar-yen exchange , Fujii said it " reflected a basic idea of G7 nations closely contacting each other , based on a view that sharp movements in one country 's currency is undesirable . "
The dollar opened at 104.15 yen in Tokyo on Friday , up 0.05 yen from the previous day 's finish of 104.10 yen .
The opening rate was slightly below New York 's late Thursday quote of 104.22 yen .
The Group of Seven comprises Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan and the United States .
Jakarta criticises Lisbon over pilgrims incident
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has criticised Lisbon for lax security for 41 pro-Indonesian East Timorese pilgrims visiting Portugal , the Antara news agency said Friday .
The group was pelted with rotten eggs and garbage by a jeering crowd on arrival at Lisbon airport Tuesday . Its leader , roving ambassador Lopez da Cruz , was called a traitor and murderer .
The group is making a pilgrimage to the Catholic shrine of Fatima .
" I am surprised such an incident could not have been prevented by the local security , " Antara quoted Alatas as telling journalists Thursday .
He said if that was how Portugal welcomed a group from Indonesia visiting in the framework of confidence-building measures , then Jakarta would think twice before allowing any more such visits .
The incident came a few days after Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart Durao Barroso met in Geneva for a new round of talks under the auspices of UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to try to find an acceptable solution to the question of East Timor .
Indonesia invaded East Timor on December 1975 and unilaterally declared the former Portuguese colony its 27th province in 1976 . The United Nations still recognizes Lisbon as the administrator of the territory .
Portugal severed ties with Indonesia shortly after the Indonesian troops entered East Timor .
Japan to send officials to US to break impasse over trade
Japan will send two senior officials to the United States next week in a bid to break the impasse in talks on bilateral trade , International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday .
He told a press conference that the officials to be sent to Washington are Sozaburo Okamatsu , his deputy for international affairs , and Sadayuki Hayashi , deputy foreign minister for economic affairs .
China appoints 13 more members to shadow government body
China has appointed 13 more members to its Preliminary Working Committee ( PWC ) -- Beijing 's shadow policy-making body in Hong Kong .
The PWC is charged with mapping out Hong Kong 's post-1997 political system in conjunction with top Beijing officials led by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen .
The latest appointments , which include businessmen , former government officials , and academicians from Hong Kong , were made Thursday after the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of China 's National People 's Congress in Beijing , the semi-official China News Service said .
