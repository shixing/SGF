At the United Nations a diplomat said that the Security Council was unlikely to approve a resolution lifting the embargo , noting that even if it had a majority among the 15 members Russia would be sure to veto it .

Dollar opens at 104.15 yen in Tokyo Multiple executions a hit with state officials Convicted murderers Jonas Whitmore and Edward Charles Pickens died by lethal injection Wednesday within about an hour of each other in the same chamber .

Multiple executions were once common in the United States .
Arkansas executed two people on four separate dates in 1960 .
Until Wednesday , no multiple executions had taken place in the United States since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 .

Pioneer psychoanalyst Erik Erikson who widened the scope of psychoanalytic theory to take greater account of social , cultural and other environmental factors , died Thursday .
He was 91 .
Erikson trained under Anna Freud -- the daughter of Sigmund Freud -- specializing in child pyschology .
Erikson graduated from the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute .
His psychohistorical studies , '' Young Man Luther '' -LRB- 1958 -RRB- and '' Gandhi 's Truth '' -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , explored the convergence of personal development and social history .
The latter won the Pulitzer and National Book Award in 1970 .

Diplomats from Europe , Russia and the United States prepared to meet here Friday amid disarray for yet another attempt to get to grips with the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina .
Washington , represented by Secretary of State Warren Christopher , also went into the talks embarrassed by a vote Thursday by the US Senate that the administration should unilaterally allow US arms shipments to the mainly-Moslem Bosnian government in defiance of a 1991 UN embargo .
But despite earlier pessimism from Washington , the US official here said it was '' possible to a large extent '' to '' agree on some kind of approach '' towards resolving the problem .
On Thursday fighting was reported at Tuzla and Bihac , both declared safe areas , and at Brcko , a potential flashpoint , while a UN military observer was killed and another seriously wounded on the edge of the Sarajevo exclusion zone . ''
It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina , which requires a political and territorial solution , '' Boutros-Ghali added .
A communique said the UN wanted to see the participants at Geneva agree at least on the need to establish a general ceasefire in Bosnia as soon as possible and to deal with the whole problem of the conflict on a global and not a piecemeal basis .

Malaysia banned '' Schindler 's List , '' then grudgingly relented .
The Philippines censorship board voted to cut certain scenes until President Fidel Ramos issued a decree to show the film in its entirety .
Another Oscar-winning film now making the rounds in Bangkok , '' The Piano '' , is being shown at its full length , but with scenes involving nudity smeared into obscurity with petroleum jelly .

India 's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes will top Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao 's agenda on his visit to the United States , his most controversial foreign trip in three years in office .
No overseas visit by Rao has generated so much heat and controversy .
On Thursday , Rao indicated that a common ground would be hard to find when he vowed not to roll back India 's nuclear and missile policies under pressure from Washington .
A day 's secret talks between Indian and US officials in London last month on the nuclear programme added to rumours that Rao may be quietly preparing to surrender India 's nuclear option .
Indian officials with an eye on China say any attempt at nuclear disarmament should be global and not restricted to a region .
A US proposal to supply 38 F-16 planes to Pakistan , with which India has fought three wars and which it accuses of backing Moslem separatism in Kashmir , has added to the list of irritants .
