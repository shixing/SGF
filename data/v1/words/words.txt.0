He would be '' sorely missed by all who are striving for progress and , in particular , by all true Europeans . ''
In Lisbon , Portuguese Socialist Party general secretary Antonio Guterres sent a message of condolences to Smith 's widow .

The French diplomat meanwhile reiterated his condemnation of the military regime in Port-au-Prince and the naming Wednesday of interim president Emile Jonassaint , whom Juppe described as a '' puppet with no legitimacy . ''
Juppe said such a force was in the process of being sent to Haiti last October before the collapse of an agreement to restore exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
Chinese dissidents in the United States generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing 's privileged trading status targeting state-owned firms , not complete revocation , dissident leaders said here Thursday .
But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the government 's intransigence , said Zhao , whose group coordinates dissident groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China .
Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China '' that all they have to do to win MFN is play tough , and they have been doing so , '' Zhao said .
Wang said that his release was a miracle , but urged the international community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in China .

But it takes time . ''
Mansell 's Indy rookie of the year performance made most people forget he ws injured just a month earlier in a crash at Phoenix in his first oval effort . ''

You get in traffic and you have dogfights and I forget I 'm on an oval . ''

A six-month probationary period would be required before the commission could verify Baghdad 's compliance with all the conditions to the Security Council , which would then consider lifting the sanctions , sources said .

Tottenham Hotspur , the London giants who narrowly escaped relegation from the English Premiership , could yet go down after being accused of making '' irregular '' loans to players .
Although the Football Association could relegate Spurs , a heavy fine is more likely as the alleged offences occurred when Tottenham were under the jurisdiction of the Football League .
The alleged offences occurred before Alan Sugar took control with the now England manager Terry Venables in 1991 .
FA chief executive Graham Kelly said Tottenham had 14 days in which to answer the charges .
Venables had his private business , Edennote , wound up in the London High Court on Thursday after it ran up a debt of 183,750 pounds to his former club .

World Cup fans at Stanford Stadium in California and in Washington are almost certain to be fenced in , against the wishes of FIFA and tournament organizers , World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg confirmed Thursday . ''
We only have the power of persuasion , '' Rothenberg said . ''
There is still a chance there might be modification in Dallas .
We 're not aware of any possible changes at Stanford Stadium -LRB- in Palo Alto , California -RRB- or at RFK Stadium in Washington . ''
He also said organizers believed the bulk of fans at World Cup matches did not pose a threat to the safety of playes and officials on the pitches . ''

And the tickets distributed through the national associations , they have a pretty good distribution mechanism where they screen who buys .
They tend to know who hooligans are and don ' t sell to them . ''

The woman , whose twin sister has already dieted herself to death , was relying on the outcome of a battle between such British media giants as Granada Television and the Daily Mirror newspaper to pay her medical bills at an exclusive clinic which specializes in bringing victims of anorexia and bulimia back to the world of the living .
Then , if everything goes well , Kendall will be flown to British Columbia to check in for between six months and a year , said the clinic 's spokeswoman Laurie Winn Stanley . ''
So we have to be fairly sure that our costs will be covered .
We are a non-profit organisation and we are not able to carry the costs ourselves . '' ''
They really must get the money together . ''
Winn Stanley said that , initially , Samantha would need around-the-clock care during which she would be hand-fed by two professional carers . ''
It 's intensive , '' she said . ''
It 's a very supporting environment . ''

Despite massive drops in weight , psychiatric counselling and hospital treatment , the girls continued their death diet into adulthood .
In a report to the Security Council released Thursday , the secretary general also said that UN Protection Forces have been stretched to the limit and should not be asked to establish more safe havens in Bosnia-Hercegovina .
The United Nations established the six safe zones about 18 months ago to protect Bosnian Moslem populations concentrated in those areas from relentless Bosnian Serbian attack . ''
It is neither configured nor equipped for mandates to fight or to hold ground , '' he said , adding that it is designed for quick deployment rather than fixed position . ''
It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina , which requires a political and territorial solution , '' he said .
It was Feyenoord 's third win in four years and ninth all-told .

Senate deals blow to Clinton with Bosnia vote by Christian Chaise The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war .
Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell said the measure had no chance of becoming law .
The administration had no immediate comment on the vote but State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said earlier that passing the measure would be '' problematic . ''
In New York , a diplomat said that the Security Council was unlikely to approve a resolution lifting the embargo , noting that even if it had a majority among the 15 members Russia would be sure to veto it . ''
From a humanitarian point of view ... the number one objective I would like to see achieved is a ceasefire .
Number two is a political settlement , '' she said . ''
I hope all the meetings and decisions would lead to these two objectives . ''

The televising of his death will bring meaning to his life , said convicted killer David Lawson .
Lawson is slated for death on June 15 .
He was convicted of murder when he shot a man during 1980 home break-in .
The event reopens debate on the issue .
National talk show host Phil Donohue has joined Lawson in his request to the North Carolina Supreme Court to overturn the ban . ''
It 's a ghoulish spectacle that 's bound to have a brutalizing , desensitizing effect on a public already jaded by images of violence , '' he added .
Gacy , a building contractor who often entertained at parties dressed as a clown , was executed for murdering 33 young men and boys during the 1970s .
Lawson said the broadcast would highlight the plight of people who suffer from chronic depression .
He said he was not aware he suffered from it until he was on Death Row .
European title for Romania Killings and threats of increased violence have overshadowed preparations for a presidential vote next week , even though the parties signed a civility pact to guarantee peace during the balloting .
Balaguer and Pena Gomez urged their supporters Thursday to refrain from violence during the final campaign events , which conclude Saturday .
The two leading candidates signed a '' Civility Pact '' on Tuesday .

Some of the 2.5 million residents of the capital also began hoarding food in anticipation of demonstrations . ''
This is normal , they always do this , '' one supermarket manager said . ''
People buy just in case , but that does not mean that there will be problems . '' ''
The election will be clean and pure , '' said Balaguer , who is seeking a third , four-year term . ''
It -LRB- the pact -RRB- will calm citizens frightened by disagreeable events . '' ''

The English giants ' march towards their second successive league title was twice , if ultimately only temporarily , stopped in its tracks by Chelsea 's economy-sized strike force .
The former , with his penetrating runs from deep positions , scored both goals in successive 1-0 victories at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford .
His angry years at Luton , Queens Park Rangers , Oxford United and Stoke now apparently behind him , the Cape Town born striker afforded a refreshingly modest response to last week 's triumphant comeback .
Romantic as it may be to visualise the Blues ' player-manager Glenn Hoddle strutting the Cup Final stage for the fourth time , at 36 he would not relish the prospect of an afternoon chasing the deep shadows of United 's orchestrator Eric Cantona .
Alex Ferguson side 's defeat at Stamford Bridge could easily have gone the other way , and the Old Trafford setback was the start of an early spring blip , now well behind them .
United fans can only hope that Schmeichel 's assurances that he has recovered from his ankle injury are motivated more by conviction than by his desperation to make up for missing the League Cup final against Aston Villa through suspension .
United themselves foiled domestic double chasing bids by Liverpool in 1977 and Everton in 1985 , with Cup Final victories .
Liverpool failed again in 1988 when they were beaten at Wembley by Wimbledon . ''
As soon as anyone does that they can get nailed .
You can come unstuck . ''
Liverpool always had a knack of bringing people down to earth .
We tried to copy it and it worked for us . '' ''
But aspects like closing people down and denying opponents chances are just as important as the glitter of the game . ''
-LRB- new series -RRB- Cheering crowds track down Jericho police by Nejla Sammakia Military sources said the officers will be part of the Jericho coordination office in charge of joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols in the area .
Many townspeople who had gathered earlier on the main road into Jericho to welcome the men had spent a frustrating day chasing around as the police were taken on a tour to inspect the Jericho region . ''
We would have waited up all night to see them , '' said Musbah Khalil , 25 .
But he added they had '' studied the problem of joint patrols and we are ready to leave . ''
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza and Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday .

Deportivo La Coruna , at home to Valencia , are a point ahead of Johan Cruyff 's Barcelona , who entertain UEFA Cup hopefuls Sevilla at the Nou Camp stadium .
Further controversy has come about over the timing of the matches of both Deportivo and Barcelona .
The Spanish federation has brought forward those fixtures , and the Athletic Bilbao-Tenerife match to Saturday at 8 : 30pm -LRB- 1830 GMT -RRB- .
But , realising Deportivo would have a distinct advantage should the Catalonians play a day earlier , Lendoiro has appealed to the Spanish federation , and may even resort to legal action .
Should Deportivo carry off the title , it will be mainly thanks to 16-goal Brazilian striker Bebeto , and the meanest defence in the league which has conceded just 18 goals in 37 matches .

The senate would require them to create a US subsidiary while the House would give them equal treatment with US banks .
LaWare also said he was opposed to a plan to strengthen regulations on derivative products , financial instruments such as futures or options .

Senate deals blow to Clinton with Bosnia vote Although the amendment , approved 50 to 49 , has little chance of becoming law , it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on resolving the conflict .
But Myers said a unilateral lifting of the embargo could encourage other countries to ignore UN sanctions on Serbia , North Korea and other nations . ''
Lifting the arms embargo is the only feasible option that will permit the Bosnian government to defend itself , '' said Senator Joseph Biden following the vote on the bill .
Europe and Russia have argued that an end to the arms embargo would escalate the fighting and quash any chance to resolve the conflict diplomatically . ''
China is not in favor of measures which could escalate the war .
We could judge against this background , '' the Beijing diplomat said . ''
From a humanitarian point of view ... the number one objective I would like to see achieved is a ceasefire .
Number two is a political settlement , '' she said . ''
