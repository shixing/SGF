Despite four oval triumphs last year , Mansell does not feel he has the circuits mastered . ''
Winning the Indy-car championship had more impact than winning the Formula One championship , '' he said . ''
I was runner-up three times basically from 1986 , so when we eventually did win Formula One , everyone was so relieved .
Winning here , everybody was more shocked and surprised . ''

People waited outside Gacy 's prison in a festive atmosphere , with vendors selling T-shirts saying '' No Tears for the Clown . ''
He said televising the events would be the modern-day equivalent of public hangings which attracted hundreds of vendors and spectators before they were halted .

The president really understands the Senate sentiment here , '' said White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers . ''
He has opposed the arm embargo in Bosnia from the beginning .

Earlier , senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies to lift the embargo .
